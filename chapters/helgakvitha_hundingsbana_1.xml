			The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane

		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The general subject of the Helgi lays is considered in the introduction to <chapterref>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</chapterref>, and it is needless here to repeat the statements there made.
		<ref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">The first lay of Helgi Hundingsbane</ref> is unquestionably one of the latest of the Eddic poems, and was composed probably not earlier than the second quarter of the eleventh century.
		It presents several unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is among the few essentially narrative poems in the whole collection, telling a consecutive story in verse, and, except for the abusive dialogue between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, which clearly was based on another and older poem, it does so with relatively little use of dialogue.
		It is, in fact, a ballad, and in the main an exceedingly vigorous one.
		The annotator, who added his prose narrative notes so freely in the other Helgi poems, here found nothing to do.
		The available evidence indicates that narrative verse was a relatively late development in Old Norse poetry, and it is significant that most of the poems which consist chiefly, not of dialogue, but of narrative stanzas, such as <ref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay</ref> and <ref chapter="Atlakvitha">the two Atli lays</ref>, can safely be dated, on the basis of other evidence, after the year 1000.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		<ref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">The first Helgi Hundingsbane lay</ref> is again differentiated from most of the Eddic poems by the character of its language.
		It is full of those verbal intricacies which were the delight of the Norse skalds, and which made Snorri's dictionary of poetic phrases an absolute necessity.
		Many of these I have paraphrased in the translation; some I have simplified or wholly avoided.
		A single line will serve to indicate the character of this form of complex diction (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">56</stanzaref>, line 4):
		<textstanza class="translation">
			And the horse of the giantess<sep />raven's-food had.
		</textstanza>
		This means simply that wolves (giantesses habitually rode on wolves) ate the bodies of the dead.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Except for its intricacies of diction, and the possible loss of a stanza here and there, the poem is comparatively simple.
		The story belongs in all its essentials to the Helgi tradition, with the Volsung cycle brought in only to the extent of making Helgi the son of Sigmund, and in the introduction of Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his sister Signy, in a passage which has little or nothing to do with the course of the narrative, and which looks like an expansion of a passage from some older poem, perhaps from the “old Volsung lay” to which the annotator of <ref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II">the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay</ref> refers (<proseref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II" prose="p13">prose after stanza 12</proseref>).
		There are many proper names, some of which betray the confusion caused by the blending of the two sets of traditions; for example, Helgi appears indiscriminately as an Ylfing (which presumably he was before the Volsung story became involved) and as a Volsung.
		Granmar and his sons are called Hniflungs (Nibelungen) in stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">50</stanzaref>, though they seem to have had no connection with this race.
		The place names have aroused much debate as to the localization of the action, but while some of them probably reflect actual places, there is so much geographical confusion, and such a profusion of names which are almost certainly mythical, that it is hard to believe that the poet had any definite locations in mind.

			The manuscript indicates no gap, but it looks as though something had been lost after line 2.

			Helgi, in the tradition as it came from Denmark, was undoubtedly an Ylfing, and the poet, in order to combine the two legends, has to treat the Ylfings and Volsungs as if they were the same family.

			<expl>Hringstathir</expl> (“Ring-Stead”): quite possibly the historical Ringsted, long a possession of the Danish kings, and thus a relic of the old Helgi tradition.
			<expl>Hringstoth</expl> may be another form of the same name.
			<expl>Solfjoll</expl> (“Sun-Mountain”) and <expl>Snæfjoll</expl> (“Snow-Mountain”) are fictitious names.

			Saxo mentions a Danish king named Sigar, and the frequency with which the name appears in the Helgi poems may be taken as a reminiscence of Denmark.
			<expl>Hotun</expl> (“High Place”): possibly the village of Tune in Seeland.
			<expl>Himinvangar</expl> (“Heaven's Field”): an imaginary place.
			<expl>Blood-snake</expl>: a sword.

			<expl>Wolf-wood</expl>: dark forest; the original word is not altogether clear.
			<expl>Southern</expl>: this variety of Valkyrie, like the swan maidens of the <chapterref>Völundarkvitha</chapterref>, was clearly regarded as of southern (i.e., German) origin.
			Here again there is a confusion of traditions; the Valkyries of the <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref> were as essentially Norse as any part of the older mythology.
			I doubt if a poet much earlier than the author of <ref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay</ref> would have made his Sigrun, daughter of Hogni, a Valkyrie.
			It is to be noted that the same complication appears in the Sigurth story, where the undoubted Valkyrie, Brynhild-Sigrdrifa (the latter name is really only an epithet) is hopelessly mixed up with the quite human Brynhild, daughter of Buthli.

			It has been suggested that this whole passage (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">33</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">48</stanzaref>) is an interpolation, perhaps from “the Old Volsung lay.”
			This may be, but it seems more probable that the poet used an older poem simply as the basis for this passage, borrowing a little but making up a great deal more.

			Here the scene shifts to the shore among Hothbrodd's followers.
			<expl>Sviputh</expl> and <expl>Sveggjuth</expl> (“Swift” and “Lithe”): horses' names.
			<expl>Mist's horse</expl>: the Valkyrie's name is the same as the English word “mist,” and the “horse” on which the mist rides is the earth.
			The two lines in parenthesis may be interpolated, or line 5 may begin a new stanza, as the manuscript indicates.

			The manuscript does not indicate the speaker, and a few editors assume the loss of one or two lines embodying the phrase “Hothbrodd spake.”

			<expl>Yngvi</expl>: one of the sons of Halfdan the Old, and traditional ancestor of the Ynglings, with whom the Ylfings seem to have been confused (cf. <chapterref>Hyndluljoth</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hyndluljoth">11</stanzaref> and note).
			The confusion between the Ylfings (or Ynglings) and Volsungs was carried far enough so that Sigurth himself is once called a descendant of Yngvi (<chapterref>Reginsmol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Reginsmol">14</stanzaref>).
			Gering identifies the name of Yngvi with the god Freyr, but the Volsungs certainly claimed descent from Othin, not Freyr, and there is nothing to indicate that Helgi in the Danish tradition was supposed to be descended from Freyr, whereas his descent from Yngvi Halfdansson fits well with the rest of his story.
			However, cf. <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">24</stanzaref> and note.

		<comment>
			This entire stanza may be an interpolation; nearly every edition has a different way of dealing with it.
			<expl>Hringstathir</expl>: as this place had been given to Helgi by his father (cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">8</stanzaref> and note), the poet has apparently made a mistake in naming it here as a conquest from Granmar's sons, unless, indeed, they had previously captured it from Helgi, which seems unlikely.
