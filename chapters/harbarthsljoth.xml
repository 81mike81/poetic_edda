	<block class="text">
		The <chapterref>Harbarthsljoth</chapterref> is found complete in the <source>Codex Regius</source>, where it follows the <chapterref>Skirnismol</chapterref>, and from the fourth line of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Harbarthsljoth">19</stanzaref> to the end of the poem in the <source>Arnamagnæan Codex</source>, of which it occupies the first page and a half.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The poem differs sharply from those which precede it in the <source>Codex Regius</source>, both in metrical form and in spirit.
		It is, indeed, the most nearly formless of all the Eddic poems.
		The normal metre is the Malahattr (cf. <ref chapter="General Introduction">General Introduction</ref>, where an example is given).
		The name of this verse-form means “in the manner of conversation,” and the <chapterref chapter="Harbarthsljoth">Harbarthsljoth's</chapterref> verse fully justifies the term.
		The Atli poems exemplify the conventional use of Malahattr, but in the <chapterref>Harbarthsljoth</chapterref> the form is used with extraordinary freedom, and other metrical forms are frequently employed.
		A few of the speeches of which the poem is composed cannot be twisted into any known Old Norse metre, and appear to be simply prose.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		How far this confusion is due to interpolations and faulty transmission of the original poem is uncertain.
		Finnur Jonsson has attempted a wholesale purification of the poem, but his arbitrary condemnation of words, lines, and entire stanzas as spurious is quite unjustified by any positive evidence.
		I have accepted Mogk's theory that the author was “a first-rate psychologist, but a poor poet,” and have translated the poem as it stands in the manuscripts.
		I have preserved the metrical confusion of the original by keeping throughout so far as possible to the metres found in the poem; if the rhythm of the translation is often hard to catch, the difficulty is no less with the original Norse.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The poem is simply a contest of abuse, such as the early Norwegian and Icelander delighted in, the opposing figures being Thor and Othin, the latter appearing in the disguise of the ferryman Harbarth.
		Such billingsgate lent itself readily to changes, interpolations and omissions, and it is little wonder that the poem is chaotic.
		It consists mainly of boasting and of references, often luckily obscure, to disreputable events in the life of one or the other of the disputants.
		Some editors have sought to read a complex symbolism into it, particularly by representing it as a contest between the noble or warrior class (Othin) and the peasant (Thor).
		But it seems a pity to take such a vigorous piece of broad farce too seriously.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Verse-form, substance, and certain linguistic peculiarities, notably the suffixed articles, point to a relatively late date (eleventh century) for the poem in its present form.
		Probably it had its origin in the early days, but its colloquial nature and its vulgarity made it readily susceptible to changes.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Owing to the chaotic state of the text, and the fact that none of the editors or commentators have succeeded in improving it much, I have not in this case attempted to give all the important emendations and suggestions.
		The stanza-divisions are largely arbitrary.

			<expl>Harbarth</expl> (“Gray-Beard”): Othin.
			On the nature of the prose notes found in the manuscripts, cf. <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref>, <proseref chapter="Grimnismol">introduction</proseref>.
			<expl>Thor</expl>: the journeys of the thunder-god were almost as numerous as those of Othin; cf. <chapterref>Thrymskvitha</chapterref> and <chapterref>Hymiskvitha</chapterref>.
			Like the Robin Hood of the British ballads, Thor was often temporarily worsted, but always managed to come out ahead in the end.
			His “Journey in the East” is presumably the famous episode, related in full by Snorri, in the course of which he en countered the giant Skrymir, and in the house of Utgartha-Loki lifted the cat which turned out to be Mithgarthsorm.
			The <chapterref>Hymiskvitha</chapterref> relates a further incident of this journey.

			<expl>In danger</expl>: Thor is “sekr,” i.e., without the protection of any law, so long as he is in the territory of his enemies, the giants.
			<expl>Meili</expl>: a practically unknown son of Othin, mentioned here only in the Edda.
			<expl>Magni</expl>: son of Thor and the giantess Jarnsaxa; after Thor's fight with Hrungnir (cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Harbarthsljoth">14</stanzaref>, note) Magni, though but three days old, was the only one of the gods strong enough to lift the dead giant's foot from Thor's neck.
			After rescuing his father, Magni said to him: “There would have been little trouble, father, had I but come sooner; I think I should have sent this giant to hell with my fist if I had met him first.”
			Magni and his brother, Mothi, inherit Thor's hammer.

		<comment>
			This stanza is hopelessly confused as to form, but none of the editorial rearrangements have materially altered the meaning.
			<expl>Doomed to die</expl>: the word “feigr” occurs constantly in the Old Norse poems and sagas; the idea of an inevitable but unknown fate seems to have been practically universal through out the pre-Christian period.
			On the concealment of names from enemies, cf. <chapterref>Fafnismol</chapterref>, <proseref chapter="Fafnismol" prose="p1">prose after stanza 1</proseref>.

			<expl>Hrungnir</expl>: this giant rashly wagered his head that his horse, Gullfaxi, was swifter than Othin's Sleipnir.
			In the race, which Hrungnir lost, he managed to dash uninvited into the home of the gods, where he became very drunk.
			Thor ejected him, and accepted his challenge to a duel.
			Hrungnir, terrified, had a helper made for him in the form of a dummy giant nine miles high and three miles broad.
			Hrungnir himself had a three-horned heart of stone and a head of stone; his shield was of stone and his weapon was a grindstone.
			But Thjalfi, Thor's servant, told him the god would attack him out of the ground, wherefore Hrungnir laid down his shield and stood on it.
			The hammer Mjollnir shattered both the grindstone and Hrungnir's head, but part of the grindstone knocked Thor down, and the giant fell with his foot on Thor's neck (cf. note on stanza <stanzaref chapter="Harbarthsljoth">9</stanzaref>).
			Meanwhile Thjalfi dispatched the dummy giant without trouble.

			<expl>Thjazi</expl>: this giant, by a trick, secured possession of the goddess Ithun and her apples (cf. <chapterref>Skirnismol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Skirnismol">19</stanzaref>, note), and carried her off into Jotunheim.
			Loki, through whose fault she had been betrayed, was sent after her by the gods.
			He went in Freyja's “hawk's-dress” (cf. <chapterref>Thrymskvitha</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Thrymskvitha">3</stanzaref>), turned Ithun into a nut, and flew back with her.
			Thjazi, in the shape of an eagle, gave chase.
			But the gods kindled a fire which burnt the eagle's wings, and then they killed him.
			Snorri's prose version does not attribute this feat particularly to Thor.
			Thjazi's daughter was Skathi, whom the gods permitted to marry Njorth as a recompense for her father's death.
			<expl>Alvaldi</expl>: of him we know only that he was the father of Thjazi, Ithi and Gang, who divided his wealth, each taking a mouthful of gold.
			The name is variously spelled.
			It is not known which stars were called “Thjazi's Eyes.” In the middle of line 4 begins the fragmentary version of the poem found in the <source>Arnamagnæan Codex</source>.

			The reference here is to one of the most familiar episodes in Thor's eastward journey.
			He and his companions came to a house in the forest, and went in to spend the night.
			Being disturbed by an earthquake and a terrific noise, they all crawled into a smaller room opening from the main one.
			In the morning, however, they discovered that the earthquake had been occasioned by the giant Skrymir's lying down near them, and the noise by his snoring.
			The house in which they had taken refuge was his glove, the smaller room being the thumb.
			Skrymir was in fact Utgartha-Loki himself.
			That he is in this stanza called Fjalar (the name occurs also in <chapterref>Hovamol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">14</stanzaref>) is probably due to a confusion of the names by which Utgartha-Loki went.
			Loki taunts Thor with this adventure in <chapterref>Lokasenna</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Lokasenna">60</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Lokasenna">62</stanzaref>, line 3 of this stanza being perhaps interpolated from <chapterref>Lokasenna</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Lokasenna">60</stanzaref>, 4.
