		<chapterref>Baldrs Draumar</chapterref> is found only in the <source>Arnamagnæan Codex</source>, where it follows the <chapterref>Harbarthsljoth</chapterref> fragment.
		It is preserved in various late paper manuscripts, with the title Vegtamskvitha (The Lay of Vegtam), which has been used by some editors.

		The poem, which contains but fourteen stanzas, has apparently been preserved in excellent condition.
		Its subject-matter and style link it closely with the <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>.
		Four of the five lines of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Baldrs Draumar">11</stanzaref> appear, almost without change, in the <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Baldrs Draumar">32</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Baldrs Draumar">33</stanzaref>, and the entire poem is simply an elaboration of the episode outlined in those and the preceding stanzas.
		It has been suggested that <chapterref>Baldrs Draumar</chapterref> and the <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref> may have been by the same author.
		There is also enough similarity in style between <chapterref>Baldrs Draumar</chapterref> and the <chapterref>Thrymskvitha</chapterref> (note especially the opening stanza) to give color to Vigfusson's guess that these two poems had a common authorship.
		In any case, <chapterref>Baldrs Draumar</chapterref> presumably assumed its present form not later than the first half of the tenth century.

		Whether the Volva (wise-woman) of the poem is identical with the speaker in the <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref> is purely a matter for conjecture.
		Nothing definitely opposes such a supposition.
		As in the longer poem she foretells the fall of the gods, so in this case she prophesies the first incident of that fall, the death of Baldr.
		Here she is called up from the dead by Othin, anxious to know the meaning of Baldr's evil dreams; in the Voluspo it is likewise intimated that the Volva has risen from the grave.

		The poem, like most of the others in the collection, is essentially dramatic rather than narrative, summarizing a story which was doubtless familiar to every one who heard the poem recited.

			Father of magic: Othin appears constantly as the god of magic.
			<expl>Hel</expl>: offspring of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha, as were the wolf Fenrir and Mithgarthsorm.
			She ruled the world of the unhappy dead, either those who had led evil lives or, according to another tradition, those who had not died in battle.
			The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and thus the editions vary in their grouping of the lines of this and the succeeding stanzas.

		<comment>
			The manuscript has no superscriptions indicating the speakers.
			<expl>Vegtam</expl> (“The Wanderer”): Othin, as usual, conceals his identity, calling himself the son of Valtam (“The Fighter”).
			In this instance he has unusual need to do so, for as the wise-woman belongs apparently to the race of the giants, she would be unwilling to answer a god's questions.
			<expl>Heaven</expl>: the word used includes all the upper worlds, in contrast to hell.
			<expl>Benches</expl>, etc.: the adornment of the benches and raised platforms, or elevated parts of the house, was a regular part of the preparation for a feast of welcome.
			The text of the two last lines is somewhat uncertain.

		</translation>
		<comment>
			The manuscript marks the third line as the beginning of a stanza; something may have been lost.
			Lines 3–4 are thoroughly obscure.
			According to Bugge the maidens who are to weep for Baldr are the daughters of the sea-god Ægir, the waves, whose grief will be so tempestuous that they will toss the ships up to the very sky.
			“Yards of the sails” is a doubtfully accurate rendering; the two words, at any rate in later Norse nautical speech, meant respectively the “tack” and the “sheet” of the square sail.

			While the wise-woman probably means only that she will never speak again till the end of the world, it has been suggested, and is certainly possible, that she intends to give Loki her counsel, thus revenging herself on Othin.
