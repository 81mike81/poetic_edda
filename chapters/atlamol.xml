			The Greenland Ballad of Atli

	<block class="section">
		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Many of the chief facts regarding the <cr>Atlamol</cr>, which follows the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> in the <src>Codex Regius</src>, are outlined in the introductory note to the <ref chapter="Atlakvitha">earlier Atli lay</ref>.
		That the superscription in the manuscript is correct, and that the poem was actually composed in Greenland, is generally accepted; the specific reference to polar bears (stanza <sr>17</sr>), and the general color of the entire poem make this origin exceedingly likely.
		Most critics, again, agree in dating the poem nearer 1100 than 1050.
		As to its state of preservation there is some dispute, but, barring one or two possible gaps of some importance, and the usual number of passages in which the interpolation or omission of one or two lines may be suspected, the <cr>Atlamol</cr> has clearly come down to us in fairly good shape.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Throughout the poem the epic quality of the story itself is overshadowed by the romantically sentimental tendencies of the poet, and by his desire to adapt the narrative to the understanding of his fellow-Greenlanders.
		The substance of the poem is the same as that of the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr>; it tells of Atli's message to the sons of Gjuki, their journey to Atli's home, the slaying of Hogni and Gunnar, Guthrun's bitterness over the death of her brothers, and her bloody revenge on Atli.
		Thus in its bare out line the <cr>Atlamol</cr> represents simply the Frankish blending of the legends of the slaughter of the Burgundians and the death of Attila (cf. <cr>Gripisspo</cr>, introductory note). But here the resemblance ends.
		The poet has added characters, apparently of his own creation, for the sake of episodes which would appeal to both the men and the women of the Greenland settlement.
		Sea voyages take the place of journeys by land; Atli is reproached, not for cowardice in battle, but for weakness at the Thing or great council.
		The additions made by the poet are responsible for the Atlamol's being the longest of all the heroic poems in the Eddic collection, and they give it a kind of emotional vivid ness, but it has little of the compressed intensity of the older poems.
		Its greatest interest lies in its demonstration of the manner in which a story brought to the North from the South Germanic lands could be adapted to the understanding and tastes of its eleventh century hearers without any material change of the basic narrative.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		In what form or forms the story of the Gjukungs and Atli reached the Greenland poet cannot be determined, but it seems likely that he was familiar with older poems on the subject, and possibly with the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> itself.
		That the details which are peculiar to the <cr>Atlamol</cr>, such as the figures of Kostbera and Glaumvor, existed in earlier tradition seems doubtful, but the son of Hogni, who aids Guthrun in the slaying of Atli, appears, though under another name, in other late versions of the story, and it is impossible to say just how much the poet relied on his own imagination and how far he found suggestions and hints in the prose or verse stories of Atli with which he was familiar.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The poem is in Malahattr (cf. <ref chapter="General Introduction">Introduction</ref>) throughout, the verse being far more regular than in the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr>.
		The compilers of the <src>Volsungasaga</src> evidently knew it in very much the form in which we now have it, for in the main it is paraphrased with great fidelity.

			It is probable that a considerable passage has been lost between stanzas <sr>39</sr> and <sr>40</sr>, for the <src>Volsungasaga</src> paraphrase includes a dialogue at this point.
			The manuscript indicates no gap, and most editions combine stanzas <sr>39</sr> and <sr>40</sr> as a single stanza.
			The prose passage, indicating the substance of what, if any thing, is lost, runs as follows:
			```Be welcome among us, and give me that store of gold which is ours by right, the gold that Sigurth had, and that now belongs to Guthrun.'
			Gunnar said: `Never shalt thou get that gold, and men of might shalt thou find here, ere we give up our lives, if it is battle thou dost offer us; in truth it seems that thou hast prepared this feast in kingly fashion, and with little grudging toward eagle and wolf.'''

			The warlike deeds of Guthrun represent an odd transformation of the German tradition.
			Kriemhild, although she did no actual fighting in the <src>Nibelungenlied</src>, was famed from early times for her cruelty and fierceness of heart, and this seems to have inspired the poet of the <chapterref>Atlamol</chapterref> to make his Guthrun into a warrior outdoing Brynhild herself.
			Kriemhild's ferocity of course, was directed against Gunther and especially Hagene, for whose slaying she rather than Etzel was responsible; here, on the other hand, Guthrun's is devoted to the defense of her brothers.

			The <src>Volsungasaga</src> gives the speech, in somewhat altered form, to Hogni:

			This presumably represents the correct form of the stanza, for nowhere else is it intimated that Atli killed Guthrun's mother, Grimhild, nor is the niece elsewhere mentioned.

			Some editions mark line 3 as spurious or defective.
			The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza.
			<expl>The land</expl>, etc.: there is much obscurity as to the significance of this line.
			Some editors omit or question ``me,'' in which case Atli is apparently reproaching Guthrun for having incited him to fight with his brothers to win for himself the whole of Buthli's land.
			In stanza <sr>91</sr> Guthrun denies that she was to blame for Atli's quarrels with his brothers.
			The <src>Volsungasaga</src> reading supports this interpretation.
			The historical Attila did actually have his brother, Bleda, killed in order to have the sole rule.
			<expl>The treasure</expl>: Sigurth's hoard, which Atli claimed as the brother of Brynhild and husband of Guthrun, Sigurth's widow, but which Gunnar and Hogni kept for themselves, with, as Atli here charges, Guthrun's connivance.
			<expl>My mother</expl>: the only other reference to Atli's mother is in <chapterref>Oddrunargratr</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">30</stanzaref>, wherein she appears as the adder who stings Gunnar to death, and in the prose passages based on that stanza.

			``Thou liest now, Atli,<sep />though little I heed it;<br />

			The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.
			It marks both lines 4 and 5 as beginning new stanzas, but line 5 is presumably an interpolation.
			The text of the second half of line 2 is obscure, and many emendations have been suggested.
			<expl>Ye brothers</expl>: cf. note on stanza <sr>90</sr>.
			<expl>Half</expl>: i. e., two of Atli's brothers were killed, the other two dying in the battle with Gunnar and Hogni; cf. stanza <sr>51</sr>.

			<expl>From the land</expl>: this maritime expedition of Guthrun and her two brothers, Gunnar and Hogni (the poet seems to know nothing of her half-brother, Gotthorm), with Sigurth seems to have been a pure invention of the poet's, inserted for the benefit of his Greenland hearers.
			Nothing further is reported concerning it.

			<expl>Hun-king</expl>: Sigurth, though most illogically so called; cf. <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">4</stanzaref> and note.
			The <src>Volsungasaga</src> paraphrase of line 2 is so remote as to be puzzling: ``It was little to bear the name of widow.''
			Perhaps, however, the word ``not'' fell out between ``was'' and ``little.''

			<expl>Thing</expl>, etc.: here the poet makes Atli into a typical Norse land-owner, going to the ``Thing,'' or general law council, to settle his disputes.
			Even the compilers of the <src>Volsungasaga</src> could not accept this, and in their paraphrase changed ``Thing'' to ``battle.''
			The text of the second half of line 2 is uncertain.
			The manuscript leaves a blank to indicate the gap in-line 4; Grundtvig adds: ``as beseems not a king.''

			The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.
			Many editors assume a gap either before or after line 1.
			<expl>A ship</expl>: the burial of Norse chiefs in ships was of frequent occurrence, but the Greenland poet's application of the custom to Atli is some what grotesque.
