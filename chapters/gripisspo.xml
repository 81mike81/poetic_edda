		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Gripisspo</cr> immediately follows the prose <cr>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</cr> in the <src>Codex Regius</src>, and is contained in no other early manuscript.
		It is unquestionably one of the latest of the poems in the Eddic collection; most critics agree in calling it the latest of all, dating it not much before the year 1200.
		Its author (for in this instance the word may be correctly used) was not only familiar with the other poems of the Sigurth cycle, but seems to have had actual written copies of them before him; it has, indeed, been suggested, and not without plausibility, that the <cr>Gripisspo</cr> may have been written by the very man who compiled and annotated the collection of poems preserved in the <src>Codex Regius</src>.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		In form the poem is a dialogue between the youthful Sigurth and his uncle, Gripir, but in substance it is a condensed outline of Sigurth's whole career as told piecemeal in the older poems.
		The writer was sufficiently skillful in the handling of verse, but he was utterly without inspiration; his characters are devoid of vitality, and their speeches are full of conventional phrases, with little force or incisiveness.
		At the same time, the poem is of considerable interest as giving, in brief form, a summary of the story of Sigurth as it existed in Iceland (for the <cr>Gripisspo</cr> is almost certainly Icelandic) in the latter half of the twelfth century.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		It is not desirable here to go in detail into the immensely complex question of the origin, growth, and spread of the story of Sigurth (Siegfried).
		The volume of critical literature on the subject is enormous, and although some of the more patently absurd theories have been eliminated, there are still wide divergencies of opinion regarding many important points.
		At the same time, a brief review of the chief facts is necessary in order to promote a clearer understanding of the poems which follow, and which make up more than a third of the Eddic collection.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		That the story of Sigurth reached the North from Germany, having previously developed among the Franks of the Rhine country, is now universally recognized.
		How and when it spread from northwestern Germany into Scandinavia are less certainly known.
		It spread, indeed, in every direction, so that traces of it are found wherever Frankish influence was extensively felt; but it was clearly better known and more popular in Norway, and in the settlements established by Norwegians, than anywhere else.
		We have historical proof that there was considerable contact, commercial and otherwise, between the Franks of northwestern Germany and the Norwegians (but not the Swedes or the Danes) throughout the period from 600 to 800; coins of Charlemagne have been found in Norway, and there is other evidence showing a fairly extensive interchange of ideas as well as of goods.
		Presumably, then, the story of the Frankish hero found its way into Norway in the seventh century.
		While, at this stage of its development, it may conceivably have included a certain amount of verse, it is altogether probable that the story as it came into Norway in the seventh century was told largely in prose, and that, even after the poets had got hold of it, the legend continued to live among the people in the form of oral prose saga.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The complete lack of contemporary material makes it impossible for us to speak with certainty regarding the character and content of the Sigurth legend as it existed in the Rhine country in the seventh century.
		It is, however, important to remember the often overlooked fact that any popular traditional hero became a magnet for originally unrelated stories of every kind.
		It must also be remembered that in the early Middle Ages there existed no such distinction between fiction and history as we now make; a saga, for instance, might be anything from the most meticulously accurate history to the wildest of fairy tales, and a single saga might (and sometimes did) combine both elements.
		This was equally true of the Frankish traditions, and the two principles just stated account for most of the puzzling phenomena in the growth of the Sigurth story.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Of the origin of Sigurth himself we know absolutely nothing.
		No historical analogy can be made to fit in the slightest degree.
		If one believes in the possibility of resolving hero stories into nature myths, he may be explained in that fashion, but such a solution is not necessary.
		The fact remains that from very early days Sigurth (Sifrit) was a great traditional hero among the Franks.
		The tales of his strength and valor, of his winning of a great treasure, of his wooing a more or less supernatural bride, and of his death at the hands of his kinsmen, probably were early features of this legend.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The next step was the blending of this story with one which had a clear basis in history.
		In the year 437 the Burgundians, under their king, Gundicarius (so the Latin histories call him), were practically annihilated by the Huns.
		The story of this great battle soon became one of the foremost of Rhineland traditions; and though Attila was presumably not present in person, he was quite naturally introduced as the famous ruler of the invading hordes.
		The dramatic story of Attila's death in the year 453 was likewise added to the tradition, and during the sixth century the chain was completed by linking together the stories of Sigurth and those of the Burgundian slaughter.
		Gundicarius becomes the Gunther of the <src>Nibelungenlied</src> and the Gunnar of the Eddic poems; Attila becomes Etzel and Atli.
		A still further development came through the addition of another, and totally unrelated, set of historical traditions based on the career of Ermanarich, king of the Goths, who died about the year 376.
		Ermanarich figures largely in many stories unconnected with the Sigurth cycle, but, with the zeal of the medieval story-tellers for connecting their heroes, he was introduced as the husband of Sigurth's daughter, Svanhild, herself originally part of a separate narrative group, and as Jormunrek he plays a considerable part in a few of the Eddic poems.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Such, briefly, appears to have been the development of the legend before it came into Norway.
		Here it underwent many changes, though the clear marks of its southern origin were never obliterated.
		The names were given Scandinavian forms, and in some cases were completely changed (e.g., Kriemhild becomes Guthrun).
		New figures, mostly of secondary importance, were introduced, and a large amount of purely Northern local color was added.
		Above all, the earlier part of the story was linked with Northern mythology in a way which seems to have had no counterpart among the southern Germanic peoples.
		The Volsungs become direct descendants of Othin; the gods are closely concerned with Fafnir's treasure, and so on.
		Above all, the Norse story-tellers and poets changed the figure of Brynhild.
		In making her a Valkyrie, sleeping on the flame-girt rock, they were never completely successful, as she persisted in remaining, to a considerable extent, the entirely human daughter of Buthli whom Sigurth woos for Gunnar.
		This confusion, intensified by a mixing of names (cf. <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr>, <ref chapter="Sigrdrifumol">introductory note</ref>), and much resembling that which existed in the parallel cases of Svava and Sigrun in the Helgi tradition, created difficulties which the Norse poets and story-tellers were never able to smooth out, and which have perplexed commentators ever since.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Those who read the Sigurth poems in the <src>Edda</src>, or the story told in the <src>Volsungasaga</src>, expecting to find a critically accurate biography of the hero, will, of course, be disappointed.
		If, however, they will constantly keep in mind the general manner in which the legend grew, its accretions ranging all the way from the Danube to Iceland, they will find that most of the difficulties are simply the natural results of conflicting traditions.
		Just as the Danish Helgi had to be ``reborn'' twice in order to enable three different men to kill him, so the story of Sigurth, as told in the Eddic poems, involves here and there inconsistencies explicable only when the historical development of the story is taken into consideration.

		<comment>
			<expl>Gjuki</expl>: the Norse form of the name Gibeche (``The Giver'').
			Gjuki is the father of Gunnar, Hogni, and Guthrun, the family which reflects most directly the Burgundian part of the tradition (cf. <ref chapter="Gripisspo">Introductory Note</ref>).
			The statement that Sigurth is to go direct from the slaying of Fafnir to Gjuki's hall involves one of the confusions resulting from the dual personality of Brynhild.
			In the older (and the original South Germanic) story, Sigurth becomes a guest of the Gjukungs before he has ever heard of Brynhild, and first sees her when, having changed forms with Gunnar, he goes to woo her for the latter.
			In an other version he finds Brynhild before he visits the Gjukungs, only to forget her as the result of the magic-draught administered by Guthrun's mother.
			Both these versions are represented in the poems of which the author of the <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref> made use, and he tried, rather clumsily, to combine them, by having Sigurth go to Gjuki's house, then find the unnamed Valkyrie, and then return to Gjuki, the false wooing following this second visit.

		<comment>
			Basing his story on the <chapterref>Sigrdrifumol</chapterref>, the poet here tells of Sigurth's finding of the Valkyrie, whom he does not identify with Brynhild, daughter of Buthli (stanza <sr>27</sr>), at all.
			His error in this respect is not surprising, in view of Brynhild's dual identity (cf. <ref chapter="Gripisspo">Introductory Note</ref>, and <chapterref>Fafnismol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Fafnismol">44</stanzaref> and note).
			<expl>Helgi</expl>: according to <chapterref>Helreith Brynhildar</chapterref> (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">8</stanzaref>), with which the author of the <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref> was almost certainly familiar, the hero for whose death Brynhild was punished was named Hjalmgunnar.
			Is Helgi here identical with Hjalmgunnar, or did the author make a mistake? Finnur Jonsson thinks the author regarded Sigurth's Valkyrie as a fourth incarnation of Svava Sigrun-Kara, and wrote Helgi's name in deliberately.
			Many editors, following Bugge, have tried to reconstruct line 2 so as to get rid of Helgi's name.

			<expl>Heimir</expl>: the <src>Volsungasaga</src> says that Heimir was the husband of Brynhild's sister, Bekkhild.
			Brynhild's family connections involve a queer mixture of northern and southern legend.
			Heimir and Bekkhild are purely of northern invention; neither of them is mentioned in any of the earlier poems, though Brynhild speaks of her ``foster-father'' in <chapterref>Helreith Brynhildar</chapterref>.
			In the older Norse poems Brynhild is a sister of Atli (Attila), a relationship wholly foreign to the southern stories, and the father of this strangely assorted pair is Buthli, who in the <src>Nibelungenlied</src> is apparently Etzel's grandfather.
			Add to this her role of Valkyrie, and it is small wonder that the annotator himself was puzzled.

			Some editors have arranged the stanzas as in this translation, while others have interchanged <sr>41</sr> and <sr>43</sr>.
			In any case, Sigurth in stanza <sr>42</sr> asks about the ``three nights'' which Gripir has never mentioned.
			I suspect that lines 3--4 of stanza <sr>41</sr>, which are practically identical with lines 3--4 of stanza <sr>23</sr>, got in here by mistake, replacing two lines which may have run thus:

		<comment>
			According to the <src>Volsungasaga</src>, Sigurth remembers his oaths to Brynhild almost immediately after his return to Gunnar's house.
			Brynhild, on the other hand, knows nothing until the famous quarrel between herself and Guthrun at the bath (an other reminiscence of the German story), when she taunts Guthrun with Sigurth's inferiority to Gunnar, and Guthrun retorts with the statement that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the flames.

		<comment>
			Brynhild tells Gunnar that Sigurth really possessed her during the three nights when he slept by her in Gunnar's form, thus violating his oath.
			Here again there is a confusion of two traditions.
			If Sigurth did not meet Brynhild until after his oath to Gunnar (cf. note on stanza <sr>13</sr>), Brynhild's charge is entirely false, as she herself admits in <chapterref>Helreith Brynhildar</chapterref>.
			On the other hand, according to the version in which Sigurth finds Brynhild before he meets Gjuki's sons, their union was not only completed, but she had by him a daughter, Aslaug, whom she leaves in Heimir's charge before going to become Gunnar's wife.
			This is the <src>Volsungasaga</src> version, and thus the statement Brynhild makes to Gunnar, as a result of which Sigurth is slain, is quite true.
