<chapter english_name="Grimnismol" icelandic_name="Grimnismǭl" translation="The Ballad of Grimnir">
	<block class="text">
		The <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref> follows the <chapterref>Vafthruthnismol</chapterref> in the <source>Codex Regius</source> and is also found complete in the <source>Arnamagnæan Codex</source>, where also it follows the <chapterref>Vafthruthnismol</chapterref>.
		Snorri quotes over twenty of its stanzas.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Like the preceding poem, the <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref> is largely encyclopedic in nature, and consists chiefly of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five of these.
		It is not, however, in dialogue form.
		As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story.
		Othin, concealed under the name of Grimnir, is through an error tortured by King Geirröth.
		Bound between two blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king's little son, Agnar, who has been kind to him.
		Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true name, or rather names, to the terrified Geirröth, and the latter falls on his sword and is killed.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		For much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose statement of the manner of Geirröth's death.
		These prose notes, of which there are many in the Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms.
		Presumably they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed such annotation in order to be clear.
		Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Without discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers of the poems.
		In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them followed a narrative sequence of ideas.
		The stories themselves appear to have lived in oral prose tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition.
		The early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story telling, and in some of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose “links” between dialogue stanzas.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The applications of this fact, which has been too often over looked, are almost limitless, for it suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called “popular” epic.
		It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages before such a poem as the <source>Iliad</source>.
		In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Interpolations in such a poem as the <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref> could have been made easily enough, and many stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.

			King Hrauthung had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other Geirröth.<br />
			Agnar was ten winters old, and Geirröth eight.<br />
			Once they both rowed in a boat with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the sea.<br />
			In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter.<br />
			The housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for Geirröth, and taught him wisdom.<br />
			In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with Geirröth.<br />
			They had a fair wind, and came to their father's landing-place.<br />
			Geirröth was forward in the boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, “Go thou now where evil may have thee!”<br />
			The boat drifted out to sea.<br />
			Geirröth, however, went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead.<br />
			Then Geirröth was made king, and became a renowned man.<br />
			<br />
			Othin and Frigg sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds.<br />
			Othin said: “Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the cave?<br />
			But Geirröth, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land.”<br />
			Frigg said: “He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too many of them come to him.”<br />
			Othin replied that this was the greatest of lies; and they made a wager about this matter.<br />
			Frigg sent her maid-servant, Fulla, to Geirröth.<br />
			She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so fierce as to leap at him.<br />
			Now it was a very great slander that King Geirröth was not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack.<br />
			He wore a dark-blue mantle and called himself Grimnir, but said no more about himself, though he was questioned.<br />
			The king had him tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there eight nights.<br />
			King Geirröth had a son ten winters old, and called Agnar after his father's brother.<br />
			Agnar went to Grimnir, and gave him a full horn to drink from, and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented with out cause.<br />
			Grimnir drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on Grimnir's back.<br />

			In the original lines 2 and 4 are both too long for the meter, and thus the true form of the stanza is doubtful.
			For line 4 both manuscripts have “the land of the Goths” instead of simply “the Goths.”
			The word “Goths” apparently was applied indiscriminately to any South-Germanic people, including the Burgundians as well as the actual Goths, and thus here has no specific application; cf. <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">35</stanzaref> and note.

		<comment>
			This stanza looks as though it originally had had nothing to do with the two preceding it.
			Snorri quotes it in his description of the three roots of Yggdrasil, and the three springs be neath them.
			“The third root of the ash stands in heaven and beneath this root is a spring which is very holy, and is called Urth's well.” (Cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">19</stanzaref>)
			“There the gods have their judgment-seat, and thither they ride each day over Bifrost, which is also called the Gods' Bridge.”
			Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning.
			Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun.
			Nothing more is known of the rivers named in this stanza.
			Lines 3–4 are almost certainly interpolated from stanza <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">30</stanzaref>.

			This and the following stanza are quoted by Snorri.
			They seem to have come from a different source from the others of this poem; Edzardi suggests an older version of the <chapterref>Vafthruthnismol</chapterref>.
			This stanza is closely parallel to <chapterref>Vafthruthnismol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Vafthruthnismol">21</stanzaref>, which see, as also <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">3</stanzaref>.
			Snorri, following this account, has a few details to add.
			The stones were made out of Ymir's teeth and such of his bones as were broken.
			Mithgarth was a mountain-wall made out of Ymir's eyebrows, and set around the earth because of the enmity of the giants.

			With this stanza Othin gets back to his immediate situation, bound as he is between two fires.
			He calls down a blessing on the man who will reach into the fire and pull aside the great kettle which, in Icelandic houses, hung directly under the smoke vent in the roof, and thus kept any one above from looking down into the interior.

			This and the following stanza are certainly interpolated, for they have nothing to do with the context, and stanza <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">45</stanzaref> continues the dramatic conclusion of the poem begun in stanza <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">42</stanzaref>.
			This stanza is quoted by Snorri.
			<expl>Ivaldi</expl> (“The Mighty”): he is known only as the father of the craftsmen-dwarfs who made not only the ship Skithblathnir, but also Othin's spear Gungnir, and the golden hair for Thor's wife, Sif, after Loki had maliciously cut her own hair off.
			<expl>Skithblathnir</expl>: this ship (“Wooden-Bladed”) always had a fair wind, whenever the sail was set; it could be folded up at will and put in the pocket.
			<expl>Freyr</expl>: concerning him and his father, see <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">21</stanzaref>, note, and <chapterref>Skirnismol</chapterref>, <proseref chapter="Skirnismol" prose="introduction">introductory prose</proseref> and note.

			Snorri quotes this stanza.
			Like stanza <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">43</stanzaref> an almost certain interpolation, it was probably drawn in by the reference to Skithblathnir in the stanza interpolated earlier.
			It is presumably in faulty condition.
			One Ms. has after the fifth line half of a sixth,—“Brimir of swords.”
			<expl>Yggdrasil</expl>: cf. stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">25</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">35</stanzaref>.
			<expl>Skithblathnir</expl>: cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">43</stanzaref>, note.
			<expl>Sleipnir</expl>: Othin's eight-legged horse, one of Loki's numerous progeny, borne by him to the stallion Svathilfari.
			This stallion belonged to the giant who built a fortress for the gods, and came so near to finishing it, with Svathilfari's aid, as to make the gods fear he would win his promised reward—Freyja and the sun and moon.
			To delay the work, Loki turned himself into a mare, whereupon the stallion ran away, and the giant failed to complete his task within the stipulated time.
			<expl>Bilrost</expl>: probably another form of Bifrost (which Snorri has in his version of the stanza), on which cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">29</stanzaref>.
			<expl>Bragi</expl>: the god of poetry.
			He is one of the later figures among the gods, and is mentioned only three times in the poems of the <source>Edda</source>.
			In Snorri's <source>Edda</source>, however, he is of great importance.
			His wife is Ithun, goddess of youth.
			Perhaps the Norwegian skald Bragi Boddason, the oldest recorded skaldic poet, had been traditionally apotheosized as early as the tenth century.
			<expl>Hobrok</expl>: nothing further is known of him.
			Garm: cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">44</stanzaref>.

			Concerning the condition of stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">46</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">50</stanzaref>, quoted by Snorri, nothing definite can be said.
			Lines and entire stanzas of this “catalogue” sort undoubtedly came and went with great freedom all through the period of oral transmission.
			Many of the names are not mentioned elsewhere, and often their significance is sheer guesswork.
			As in nearly every episode Othin appeared in disguise, the number of his names was necessarily almost limitless.
			<expl>Grim</expl>: “The Hooded.”
			<expl>Gangleri</expl>: “The Wanderer.”
			<expl>Herjan</expl>: “The Ruler.”
			<expl>Hjalmberi</expl>: “The Helmet-Bearer.”
			<expl>Thekk</expl>: “The Much-Loved.”
			<expl>Thrithi</expl>: “The Third” (in Snorri's <source>Edda</source> the stories are all told in the form of answers to questions, the speakers being Har, Jafnhar and Thrithi.
			Just what this tripartite form of Othin signifies has been the source of endless debate.
			Probably this line is late enough to betray the somewhat muddled influence of early Christianity.)
			<expl>Thuth</expl> and <emph>Uth</emph>: both names defy guesswork.
			<expl>Helblindi</expl>: “Hel-Blinder” (two manuscripts have <emph>Herblindi</emph>—“Host-Blinder”).
			<expl>Hor</expl>: “The High One.”
