	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Hamthesmol</cr>, the concluding poem in the <src>Codex Regius</src>, is on the whole the worst preserved of all the poems in the collection.
		The origin of the story, the relation of the <cr>Hamthesmol</cr> to the <cr>Guthrunarhvot</cr>, and of both poems to the hypothetical ``old'' <cr>Hamthesmol</cr>, are outlined in the introductory note to the <cr>Guthrunarhvot</cr>.
		The <cr>Hamthesmol</cr> as we have it is certainly not the ``old'' poem of that name; indeed it is so pronounced a patchwork that it can hardly be regarded as a coherent poem at all.
		Some of the stanzas are in Fornyrthislag, some are in Malahattr, one (stanza <sr>29</sr>) appears to be in Ljothahattr, and in many cases the words can be adapted to any known metrical form only by liberal emendation.
		That any one should have deliberately com posed such a poem seems quite incredible, and it is far more likely that some eleventh century narrator constructed a poem about the death of Hamther and Sorli by piecing together various fragments, and possibly adding a number of Malahattr stanzas of his own.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		It has been argued, and with apparently sound logic, that our extant <cr>Hamthesmol</cr> originated in Greenland, along with the <cr>Atlamol</cr>.
		In any case, it can hardly have been put together before the latter part of the eleventh century, although the ``old'' <cr>Hamthesmol</cr> undoubtedly long antedates this period.
		Many editors have attempted to pick out the parts of the extant poem which were borrowed from this older lay, but the condition of the text is such that it is by no means clear even what stanzas are in Fornyrthislag and what in Malahattr.
		Many editors, likewise, indicate gaps and omissions, but it seems doubtful whether the extant <cr>Hamthesmol</cr> ever had a really consecutive quality, its component fragments having apparently been strung together with little regard for continuity.
		The notes indicate some of the more important editorial suggestions, but make no attempt to cover all of them, and the metrical form of the translation is often based on mere guesswork as to the character of the original lines and stanzas.
		Despite the chaotic state of the text, however, the underlying narrative is reasonably clear, and the story can be followed with no great difficulty.

		</translation>
		<comment>
			In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza <sr>21</sr>, and some editors take the word here rendered ``fame-glad one'' (hróþrgoþ) to be a proper name (Jormunrek's mother or his concubine).
			The <src>Volsungasaga</src>, however, indicates that Guthrun at this point ``had so fashioned their war-gear that iron would not bite into it, and she bade them to have nought to do with stones or other heavy things, and told them that it would be ill for them if they did not do as she said.''
			The substance of this counsel may well have been conveyed in a passage lost after line 3, though the manuscript indicates no gap.
			It is by being stoned that Hamther and Sorli are killed (stanza <sr>26</sr>).
			On the other hand, the second part of line 3 may possibly mean ``if silent ye are not,'' in which case the advice relates to Hamther's speech to Jormunrek and Sorli's reproach to him thereupon (stanzas <sr>25</sr> and <sr>27</sr>).
			<expl>Steps</expl>: the word in the original is doubtful.
			Line 3 is thoroughly obscure.
			Some editors make a separate stanza of lines 3--5, while others question line 5.

			</textstanza>
			In the <src>Volsungasaga</src>, after Erp's death, Hamther stumbles and saves himself from falling with his hand, whereupon he says: ``Erp spake truly; I had fallen had I not braced myself with my hand.''
