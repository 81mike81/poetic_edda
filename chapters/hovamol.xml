		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		This poem follows the <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref> in the <source>Codex Regius</source>, but is preserved in no other manuscript.
		The first stanza is quoted by Snorri, and two lines of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">84</stanzaref> appear in one of the sagas.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		In its present shape it involves the critic of the text in more puzzles than any other of the Eddic poems.
		Without going in detail into the various theories, what happened seems to have been somewhat as follows.
		There existed from very early times a collection of proverbs and wise counsels, which were attributed to Othin just as the Biblical proverbs were to Solomon.
		This collection, which presumably was always elastic in extent, was known as “The High One's Words,” and forms the basis of the present poem.
		To it, however, were added other poems and fragments dealing with wisdom which seemed by their nature to imply that the speaker was Othin.
		Thus a catalogue of runes, or charms, was tacked on, and also a set of proverbs, differing essentially in form from those comprising the main collection.
		Here and there bits of verse more nearly narrative crept in; and of course the loose structure of the poem made it easy for any reciter to insert new stanzas almost at will.
		This curious miscellany is what we now have as the <chapterref>Hovamol</chapterref>.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Five separate elements are pretty clearly recognizable: (1) the <chapterref>Hovamol</chapterref> proper (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">1</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">80</stanzaref>), a collection of proverbs and counsels for the conduct of life; (2) the <source>Loddfafnismol</source> (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">111</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">138</stanzaref>), a collection somewhat similar to the first, but specific ally addressed to a certain Loddfafnir; (3) the <source>Ljothatal</source> (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">147</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">165</stanzaref>), a collection of charms; (4) the love-story of Othin and Billing's daughter (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">96</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">102</stanzaref>), with an introductory dissertation on the faithlessness of women in general (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">81</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">95</stanzaref>), which probably crept into the poem first, and then pulled the story, as an apt illustration, after it; (5) the story of how Othin got the mead of poetry—the draught which gave him the gift of tongues—from the maiden Gunnloth (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">103</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">110</stanzaref>).
		There is also a brief passage (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">139</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">146</stanzaref>) telling how Othin won the runes, this passage being a natural introduction to the <source>Ljothatal</source>, and doubtless brought into the poem for that reason.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		It is idle to discuss the authorship or date of such a series of accretions as this.
		Parts of it are doubtless among the oldest relics of ancient Germanic poetry; parts of it may have originated at a relatively late period.
		Probably, however, most of its component elements go pretty far back, although we have no way of telling how or when they first became associated.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		It seems all but meaningless to talk about “interpolations” in a poem which has developed almost solely through the process of piecing together originally unrelated odds and ends.
		The notes, therefore, make only such suggestions as are needed to keep the main divisions of the poem distinct.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Few gnomic collections in the world's literary history present sounder wisdom more tersely expressed than the <chapterref>Hovamol</chapterref>.
		Like the Book of Proverbs it occasionally rises to lofty heights of poetry.
		If it presents the worldly wisdom of a violent race, it also shows noble ideals of loyalty, truth, and unfaltering courage.

			Some editors have combined this stanza in various ways with the last two lines of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">11</stanzaref>, as in the manuscript the first two lines of the latter are abbreviated, and, if they belong there at all, are presumably identical with the first two lines of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">10</stanzaref>.

			This stanza is certainly in bad shape, and probably out of place here.
			Its reference to runes as magic signs suggests that it properly belongs in some list of charms like the <source>Ljothatal</source> (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">147</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">165</stanzaref>).
			The stanza-form is so irregular as to show either that something has been lost or that there have been interpolations.
			The manuscript indicates no lacuna; Gering fills out the assumed gap as follows:
			<textstanza class="translation">
				Certain is that which is sought from runes,<br />
				The runes—, etc.

			With this stanza the verse-form, as indicated in the translation, abruptly changes to Malahattr.
			What has happened seems to have been something like this.
			Stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">80</stanzaref> introduces the idea of man's love for woman.
			Consequently some reciter or compiler (or possibly even a copyist) took occasion to insert at this point certain stanzas concerning the ways of women.
			Thus stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">80</stanzaref> would account for the introduction of stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">81</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">82</stanzaref>, which, in turn, apparently drew stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">83</stanzaref> in with them.
			Stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">84</stanzaref> suggests the fickleness of women, and is immediately followed—again with a change of verse-form—by a list of things equally untrustworthy (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">85</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">90</stanzaref>).
			Then, after a few more stanzas on love in the regular measure of the <chapterref>Hovamol</chapterref> (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">91</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">95</stanzaref>), is introduced, by way of illustration, Othin's story of his adventure with Billing's daughter (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">96</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">102</stanzaref>).
			Some such process of growth, whatever its specific stages may have been, must be assumed to account for the curious chaos of the whole passage from stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">81</stanzaref> to stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">102</stanzaref>.

			With this stanza begins the <source>Loddfafnismol</source> (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">111</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">138</stanzaref>).
			Loddfafnir is apparently a wandering singer, who, from his “chanter's stool,” recites the verses which he claims to have received from Othin.
			<expl>Wells of Urth</expl>: cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">19</stanzaref> and note.
			<expl>Urth</expl> (“the Past”) is one of the three Norns.
			This stanza is apparently in corrupt form, and editors have tried many experiments with it, both in rejecting lines as spurious and in rear ranging the words and punctuation.
			It looks rather as though the first four lines formed a complete stanza, and the last four had crept in later.
			The phrase translated “the speech of Hor” is “Hova mol,” later used as the title for the entire poem.

			Lines 1–3 are the formula, repeated (abbreviated in the manuscript) in most of the stanzas, with which Othin prefaces his counsels to Loddfafnir, and throughout this section, except in stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">111</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">138</stanzaref>, Loddfafnir represents himself as simply quoting Othin's words.
			The material is closely analogous to that contained in the first eighty stanzas of the poem.
			In some cases (e. g., stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">117</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">119</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">121</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">126</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">130</stanzaref>) the formula precedes a full four-line stanza instead of two (or three) lines.

			In the manuscript this stanza comes at the end of the entire poem, following stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">165</stanzaref>.
			Most recent editors have followed Müllenhoff in shifting it to this position, as it appears to conclude the passage introduced by the somewhat similar stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">111</stanzaref>.

		<comment>
			With this stanza begins the most confusing part of the <chapterref>Hovamol</chapterref>: the group of eight stanzas leading up to the Ljothatal, or list of charms.
			Certain paper manuscripts have before this stanza a title: “Othin's Tale of the Runes.”
			Apparently stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">139</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">140</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">142</stanzaref> are fragments of an account of how Othin obtained the runes; <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">141</stanzaref> is erroneously inserted from some version of the magic mead story (cf. stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">104</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">110</stanzaref>); and stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">143</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">144</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">145</stanzaref>, and <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">146</stanzaref> are from miscellaneous sources, all, however, dealing with the general subject of runes.
			With stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">147</stanzaref> a clearly continuous passage begins once more.
			<expl>The windy tree</expl>: the ash Yggdrasil (literally “the Horse of Othin,” so called because of this story), on which Othin, in order to win the magic runes, hanged himself as an offering to himself, and wounded himself with his own spear.
			Lines 5 and 6 have presumably been borrowed from <chapterref>Svipdagsmol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Svipdagsmol">30</stanzaref>.

		</translation>
		<comment>
			This stanza, interrupting as it does the account of Othin's winning the runes, appears to be an interpolation.
			The meaning of the stanza is most obscure.
			Bolthorn was Othin's grandfather, and Bestla his mother.
			We do not know the name of the uncle here mentioned, but it has been suggested that this son of Bolthorn was Mimir (cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">27</stanzaref> and note, and <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">47</stanzaref> and note).
			In any case, the nine magic songs which he learned from his uncle seem to have enabled him to win the magic mead (cf. stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">104</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">110</stanzaref>).
			Concerning <expl>Othrörir</expl>, here used as the name of the vessel containing the mead, cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">107</stanzaref> and note.

			<expl>Dain</expl> and <expl>Dvalin</expl>: dwarfs; cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">14</stanzaref>, and note.
			Dain, however, may here be one of the elves rather than the dwarf of that name.
			The two names also appear together in <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">33</stanzaref>, where they are applied to two of the four harts that nibble at the topmost twigs of Yggdrasil.
			<expl>Alsvith</expl> (“the All Wise”) appears nowhere else as a giant's name.

			We have no further information concerning the list of those who wrote the runes for the various races, and these four lines seem like a confusion of names in the rather hazy mind of some reciter.

			This Malahattr stanza appears to be a regular religious formula, concerned less with the runes which one “writes” and “tints” (cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">79</stanzaref>) than with the prayers which one “asks” and the sacrifices which one “offers” and “sends.”
			Its origin is wholly uncertain, but it is clearly an interpolation here.
