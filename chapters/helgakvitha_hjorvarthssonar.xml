	<block class="text">
		The three Helgi lays, all found in the <src>Codex Regius</src>, have been the subjects of a vast amount of discussion, in spite of which many of the facts regarding them are still very far from settled.
		It is, indeed, scarcely possible to make any unqualified statement regarding these three poems for which a flat contradiction cannot be found in the writings of some scholar of distinction.
		The origin of the Helgi tradition, its connection with that of Sigurth, the authorship, date and home of the poems, the degree to which they have been altered from their original forms, the status of the composer of the copious prose notes: these and many other allied questions have been and probably always will be matters of dispute among students of the <src>Edda's</src> history.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Without attempting to enter into the discussion in detail, certain theories should be noted.
		Helgi appears originally to have been a Danish popular hero, the son of King Halfdan.
		Saxo Grammaticus has a good deal to say about him in that capacity, and it has been pointed out that many of the place names in the Helgi lays can be pretty clearly identified with parts of Denmark and neighboring stretches of the Baltic.
		The Danish Helgi, according to Saxo, was famed as the conqueror of Hunding and Hothbrodd, the latter as the result of a naval expedition at the head of a considerable fleet.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		From Denmark the story appears to have spread northward into Norway and westward into the Norse settlements among the islands.
		Not many of its original features remained, and new ones were added here and there, particularly with regard to Helgi's love affair with Sigrun.
		The victories over Hunding and Hothbrodd, however, were generally retained, and out of material relating to these two fights, and to the Helgi-Sigrun story, were fashioned the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		How the Helgi legend became involved with that of the Volsungs is an open question.
		Both stories travelled from the South, and presumably about the same time, so it is not unnatural that some confusion should have arisen.
		At no time, however, was the connection particularly close so far as the actual episodes of the two stories were concerned.
		In the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane the relationship is established only by the statement that Helgi was the son of Sigmund and Borghild; Sigurth is not mentioned, and in the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth there is no connection at all.
		On the other hand, Helgi does not appear in any of the Eddic poems dealing directly with the Volsung stories, although in one passage of doubtful authenticity (cf. <cr>Reginsmol</cr>, <ref chapter="Reginsmol">introductory note</ref>) his traditional enemy, Hunding, does, represented by his sons.
		In the <src>Volsungasaga</src> the story of Helgi, including the fights with Hunding and Hothbrodd and the love affair with Sigrun, is told in chapters 8 and 9 without otherwise affecting the course of the narrative.
		Here, as in the Helgi lays, Helgi is the son of Sigmund Volsungsson and Borghild; Sigurth, on the other hand, is the son of Sigmund and Hjordis, the latter being the daughter of King Eylimi.
		Still another son, who complicates both stories somewhat, is Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his own sister, Signy.
		Sinfjotli appears in both of the Helgi Hundingsbane lays and in the <src>Volsungasaga</src>, but not in any of the Eddic poems belonging to the Volsung cycle (cf. <cr>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</cr> and note).
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		There is a certain amount of resemblance between the story of Helgi and Sigrun and that of Sigurth and Brynhild, particularly as the annotator responsible for the prose notes insists that Sigrun was a Valkyrie.
		Whether this resemblance was the cause of bringing the two stories together, or whether the identification of Helgi as Sigmund's son resulted in alterations of the love story in the Helgi poems, cannot be determined.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The first of the three Helgi poems, the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, is a somewhat distant cousin of the other two.
		The Helgi in question is apparently the same traditional figure, and he leads a naval expedition, but he is not the son of Sigmund, there is no connection with the Volsung cycle, and his wife is Svava, not Sigrun.
		At the same time, the points of general resemblance with the two Helgi Hundingsbane lays are such as to indicate a common origin, provided one goes far enough back.
		The annotator brings the stories together by the naive expedient of having Helgi ``born again,'' and not once only, but twice.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The first Helgi lay, is manifestly in bad shape, and includes at least two distinct poems, differentiated not only by subject matter but by metrical form.
		Although the question is debatable, the longer of these poems (stanzas <sr>1</sr>--<sr>11</sr> and <sr>31</sr>--<sr>43</sr>) seems in turn to have been compounded out of fragments of two or more Helgi poems.
		The first five stanzas are a dialogue between a bird and Atli, one of Hjorvarth's followers, concerning the winning of Sigrlin, who is destined to be Hjorvarth's wife and Helgi's mother.
		Stanzas <sr>6</sr>--<sr>11</sr> are a dialogue between Helgi and a Valkyrie (the accompanying prose so calls her, and identifies her as Svava, but there is nothing in the verse to prove this).
		Stanzas <sr>12</sr>--<sr>30</sr> form a fairly consecutive unit, in which Atli, on guard over Helgi's ship, has a vigorous argument with a giantess, Hrimgerth, whence this section has sometimes been called the <src>Hrimgertharmol</sr> (</sr>Lay of Hrimgerth</sr>).
		The last section, stanzas <sr>31</sr>--<sr>43</sr>, is, again fairly consecutive, and tells of the death of Helgi following the rash oath of his brother, Hethin, to win Svava for himself.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Parts I, II, and IV may all have come from the same poem or they may not; it is quite impossible to tell surely.
		All of them are generally dated by commentators not later than the first half of the tenth century, whereas the <src>Hrimgertharmol</src> (section III) is placed considerably later.
		When and by whom these fragments were pieced together is another vexed question, and this involves a consideration of the prose notes and links, of which the <cr>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</cr> has a larger amount than any other poem in the <src>Edda</src>.
		These prose links contain practically all the narrative, the verse being almost exclusively dialogue.
		Whoever composed them seems to have been consciously trying to bring his chaotic verse material into some semblance of unity, but he did his work pretty clumsily, with manifest blunders and contradictions.
		Bugge has advanced the theory that these prose passages are to be regarded as an original and necessary part of the work, but this hardly squares with the evidence.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		It seems probable, rather, that as the Helgi tradition spread from its native Denmark through the Norse regions of the North and West, and became gradually interwoven, although not in essentials, with the other great hero cycle from the South, that of the Volsungs, a considerable number of poems dealing with Helgi were composed, at different times and in different places, reflecting varied forms of the story.
		Many generations after wards, when Iceland's literary period had arrived, some zealous scribe committed to writing such poems or fragments of poems as he knew, piecing them together and annotating them on the basis of information which had reached him through other channels.
		The prose notes to <cr>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</cr> frankly admit this patchwork process: a section of four stanzas (<sr>13</sr>--<sr>16</sr>) is introduced with the phrase, ``as is said in the Old Volsung Lay''; the final prose note cites an incident ``told in the <src>Karuljoth</cr> (<src>Lay of Kara</src>),'' and a two-line speech is quoted ``as it was written before in the <src>Helgakvitha</src>.''
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The whole problem of the origin, character and home of the Helgi poems has been discussed in great detail by Bugge in his <src>Helge-Digtene i den Ældre Edda, Deres Hjem og Forbindelser</src>, which, as translated by W. H. Schofield under the title <src>The Home of the Eddic Poems</src>, is available for readers of English.
		This study is exceedingly valuable, if not in all respects convincing.
		The whole matter is so complex and so important in the history of Old Norse literature, and any intelligent reading of the Helgi poems is so dependent on an understanding of the conditions under which they have come down to us, that I have here discussed the question more extensively than the scope of a mere introductory note to a single poem would warrant.

			Hjorvarth was the name of a king, who had four wives: one was called Alfhild, and their son was named Hethin; the second was called Særeith, and their son was named Humlung; the third was called Sinrjoth, and their son was named Hymling.<br />
			King Hjorvarth had made a great vow to have as wife whatsoever woman he knew was fairest.<br />
			He learned that King Svafnir had a daughter fairer than all others, whose name was Sigrlin.<br />
			Ithmund was the name of one of his jarls; he had a son called Atli, who went to woo Sigrlin on behalf of the king.<br />
			He dwelt the winter long with King Svafnir.<br />
			There was a jarl called Franmar, Sigrlin's foster-father; his daughter was named Alof.<br />
			The jarl told him that the maiden's hand was denied, and Atli went home.<br />
			Atli, the jarl's son, stood one day in a certain wood; a bird sat in the branches up over him, and it had heard that his men called Hjorvarth's wives the fairest of women.<br />

		<comment>
			In the manuscript the sub-title, ``Of Hjorvarth and Sigrlin,'' stands as the title for the whole poem, though it clearly applies only to the first five stanzas.
			Most editions employ the title here given.
			<expl>Hjorvarth</expl>: the name is a not uncommon one; there are two men of that name mentioned in the mythical heroic genealogies of the <chapterref>Hyndluljoth</chapterref> (stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hyndluljoth">23</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Hyndluljoth">28</stanzaref>), and Hjorvarth appears in <chapterref>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</chapterref> (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">14</stanzaref>) and <chapterref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II">II</chapterref> (prose after stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II">12</stanzaref>) as a son of Hunding.
			This particular Hjorvarth is called by the annotator, but not directly so in the verse, a king of Norway.
			The name means ``Sword-Guardian.''
			<expl>Four wives</expl>: polygamy, while very infrequent, appears occasionally in the Norse sagas.
			<expl>Alfhild</expl>: ``Elf-Warrior.'' Hethin: ``Fur-Clothed'' (?).
			<expl>Særeith</expl>: ``Sea-Rider.'' Sinrjoth: ``Ever-Red.'' The fourth wife, not here named, may be Sigrlin.
			It has been suggested that Særeith and Sinrjoth may be northern and southern forms of the same name, as also <expl>Humlung</expl> and <expl>Hymling</expl>, their sons.
			<expl>Svafnir</expl>: the annotator calls him king of Svavaland, apparently a place on the mainland which could be reached from Norway either by land or by sea.
			<expl>Sigrlin</expl>: ``The Conquering Serpent.''
			<expl>Atli</expl>: Norse form of the Gothic Attila (Etzel).
			<expl>Alof</expl>: perhaps a feminine form of Olaf.
			<expl>A bird</expl>: compare the counsel given by the birds to Sigurth after the slaying of Fafnir (<chapterref>Fafnismol</chapterref>, stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Fafnismol">32</stanzaref>--<stanzaref chapter="Fafnismol">38</stanzaref>).
			This is one of the many curious resemblances between the Helgi and the Sigurth stories.

			<expl>Iron<expl>: the keels of Norse ships were sometimes fitted with iron ``shoes'' at bow and stern, but it is not certain that this practice much antedated the year 1000, and thus this line has raised some question as to the antiquity of this stanza, if not of the entire <src>Hrimgertharmol</src>, which may have been composed as late as the eleventh century.

			King Helgi was a mighty warrior.<br />
			He came to King Eylimi and sought the hand of his daughter, Svava.<br />
			Then Helgi and Svava exchanged vows, and greatly they loved each other.<br />
			Svava was at home with her father, while Helgi was in the field; Svava was still a Valkyrie as before.<br />
			Hethin was at home with his father, King Hjorvarth, in Norway.<br />
			Hethin was coming home alone from the forest one Yule-eve, and found a troll-woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle.<br />
			She asked Hethin for his company.<br />
			``Nay,'' said he.<br />
			She said, ``Thou shalt pay for this at the king's toast.''<br />
			That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the king's toast.<br />

			The manuscript does not indicate a new section of the poem.
			<expl>Eylimi</expl>: cf. note on prose after stanza <sr>9</sr>.
			<expl>Valkyrie</expl>: here, as before, the annotator has apparently nothing but his own imagination on which to base his statement.
			Svava in the ensuing stanzas certainly does not behave like a Valkyrie.
			<expl>Norway</expl>: the annotator doubtless based this statement on the reference to Norway in line 2 of stanza <sr>31</sr>.
			<expl>Yule-eve</expl>: the Yule feast, marking the new year, was a great event in the heathen North.
			It was a time of feasting and merrymaking, vows (``New Year's resolutions''), ghosts and witches; the spirits had their greatest power on Yule-eve.
			<expl>The king's toast</expl>: vows made at the passing of the king's cup at the Yule feast were particularly sacred.
			<expl>Sacred boar</expl>: a boar consecrated to Freyr, an integral part of the Yule rites.
			Hethin's vow, which is, of course, the vengeance of the troll-woman, is too sacred to be broken, but he immediately realizes the horror of his oath.

			Regarding this extraordinary bit see the <proseref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II" prose="conclusion">prose note</proseref> at the end of <chapterref>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</chapterref>.
			Gering thinks the reborn Helgi Hjorvarthsson was Helgi Hundingsbane, while Svava, according to the annotator himself, became Sigrun.
			The point seems to be simply that there were so many Helgi stories current, and the hero died in so many irreconcilable ways, that tradition had to have him born over again, not once only but several times, to accommodate his many deaths, and to avoid splitting him up into several Helgis.
			Needless to say, the poems themselves know nothing of this rebirth, and we owe the suggestion entirely to the annotator, who probably got it from current tradition.
