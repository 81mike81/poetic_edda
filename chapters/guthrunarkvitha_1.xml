	<block class="text">
		The <src>First Lay of Guthrun</src>, entitled in the <src>Codex Regius</src> simply <src>Guthrunarkvitha</src>, immediately follows the remaining fragment of the ``long'' Sigurth lay in that manuscript.
		Unlike the poems dealing with the earlier part of the Sigurth cycle, the so-called <cr>Reginsmol</cr>, <cr>Fafnismol</cr>, and <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr>, it is a clear and distinct unit, apparently complete and with few and minor interpolations.
		It is also one of the finest poems in the entire collection, with an extraordinary emotional intensity and dramatic force.
		None of its stanzas are quoted elsewhere, and it is altogether probable that the compilers of the <src>Volsungasaga</src> were unfamiliar with it, for they do not mention the sister and daughter of Gjuki who appear in this poem, or Herborg, ``queen of the Huns'' (stanza <sr>6</sr>).
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The lament of Guthrun (Kriemhild) is almost certainly among the oldest parts of the story.
		The lament was one of the earliest forms of poetry to develop among the Germanic peoples, and I suspect, though the matter is not susceptible of proof, that the lament of Sigurth's wife had assumed lyric form as early as the seventh century, and reached the North in that shape rather than in prose tradition (cf. <cr>Guthrunarkvitha II</cr>, introductory note).
		We find traces of it in the seventeenth Aventiure of the <src>Nibelungenlied</src>, and in the poems of the <src>Edda</src> it dominates every appearance of Guthrun.
		The two first Guthrun lays (I and II) are both laments, one for Sigurth's death and the other including both that and the lament over the slaying of her brothers; the lament theme is apparent in the third Guthrun lay and in the <cr>Guthrunarhvot</cr>.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		In their present forms the second Guthrun lay is undoubtedly older than he first; in the prose following the Brot the annotator refers to the ``old'' Guthrun lay in terms which can apply only to the second one in the collection.
		The shorter and ``first'' lay, therefore, can scarcely have been composed much before the year 1000, and may be somewhat later.
		The poet appears to have known and made use of the older lament; stanza <sr>17</sr>, for example, is a close parallel to stanza <sr>2</sr> of the earlier poem; but whatever material he used he fitted into a definite poetic scheme of his own.
		And while this particular poem is, as critics have generally agreed, one of the latest of the collection, it probably represents one of the earliest parts of the entire Sigurth cycle to take on verse form.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		<cr>Guthrunarkvitha I</cr>, so far as the narrative underlying it is concerned, shows very little northern addition to the basic German tradition.
		Brynhild appears only as Guthrun's enemy and the cause of Sigurth's death; the three women who attempt to comfort Guthrun, though unknown to the southern stories, seem to have been rather distinct creations of the poet's than traditional additions to the legend.
		Regarding the relations of the various elements in the Sigurth cycle, cf. introductory note to <cr>Gripisspo</cr>.

			Guthrun sat by the dead Sigurth; she did not weep as other women, but her heart was near to bursting with grief.<br />
			The men and women came to her to console her, but that was not easy to do.<br />
			It is told of men that Guthrun had eaten of Fafnir's heart, and that she understood the speech of birds.<br />
			This is a poem about Guthrun.

			The prose follows the concluding prose of the Brot without indication of a break, the heading standing immediately before stanza <sr>1</sr>.
			<expl>Fafnir's heart</expl>: this bit of information is here quite without point, and it is nowhere else stated that Guthrun understood the speech of birds.
			In the <src>Volsungasaga</src> it is stated that Sigurth gave Guthrun some of Fafnir's heart to eat, ``and thereafter she was much grimmer than before, and wiser.''

			<expl>Herborg</expl>: neither she nor her sorrows are elsewhere mentioned, nor is it clear what a ``queen of the Huns'' is doing in Gunnar's home, but the word ``Hun'' has little definiteness of meaning in the poems, and is frequently applied to Sigurth himself (cf. note on stanza <sr>24</sr>).
			Herborg appears from stanza <sr>11</sr> to have been the foster-mother of Gollrond, Guthrun's sister.
			Lines 5--7 may be interpolations, or may form a separate stanza.

			Editors are agreed that this stanza shows interpolations, but differ as to the lines to reject.
			Line 4 (literally ``every wave of ill-doing drives thee'') is substantially a proverb, and line 5, with its apparently meaningless reference to ``seven'' kings, may easily have come from some other source.

			The flame of the snake's bed<sep />flash round the hero;<br />

			And ever I seek<sep />the sight to forget.)''
		</translation>
		<comment>
			The stanza is obviously in bad shape; perhaps it represents two separate stanzas, or perhaps three of the lines are later additions.
			<expl>Atli</expl>: Brynhild here blames her brother, following the frequent custom of transferring the responsibility for a murder (cf. <chapterref>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II">33</stanzaref>), because he compelled her to marry Gunnar against her will, an idea which the poet seems to have gained from <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">32</stanzaref>--<stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">39</stanzaref>.
			These stanzas represent an entirely different version of the story, wherein Atli, attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, buys them off by giving Gunnar his sister, Brynhild, as wife.
			He seems to have induced the latter to marry Gunnar by falsely telling her that Gunnar was Sigurth (a rationalistic explanation of the interchange of forms described in the <src>Volsungasaga and</src> <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">37</stanzaref>--<stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">39</stanzaref>).
			In the present stanza Atli is made to do this out of desire for Sigurth's treasure.
			<expl>Hunnish race</expl>: this may be merely an error (neither Gunnar nor Sigurth could properly have been connected in any way with Atli and his Huns), based on <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref>, wherein Sigurth appears more than once as the ``Hunnish king.''
			The North was very much in the dark as to the differences between Germans, Burgundians, Franks, Goths, and Huns, and used the words without much discrimination.
			On the other hand, it may refer to Sigurth's appearance when, adorned with gold, he came with Gunnar to besiege Atli, in the alternative version of the story just cited (cf. <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">36</stanzaref>).
			<expl>Flame of the snake's bed</expl>: gold, so called because serpents and dragons were the' traditional guardians of treasure, on which they lay.
