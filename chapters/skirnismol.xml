<chapter english_name="Skirnismol" icelandic_name="Skirnismǭl" translation="The Ballad of Skirnir">
	<block class="text">
		The Skirnismol is found complete in the <source>Codex Regius</source>, and through stanza <stanzaref chapter="Skirnismol">27</stanzaref> in the <source>Arnamagnæan Codex</source>.
		Snorri quotes the concluding stanza.
		In Regius the poem is entitled “For Scirnis” (“Skirnir's journey”).
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The Skirnismol differs sharply from the poems preceding it, in that it has a distinctly ballad quality.
		As a matter of fact, however, its verse is altogether dialogue, the narrative being supplied in the prose “links,” concerning which cf. <chapterref chapter="Grimnismol">introductory note</chapterref> to the <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref>.
		The dramatic effectiveness and vivid characterization of the poem seem to connect it with the <chapterref>Thrymskvitha</chapterref>, and the two may possibly have been put into their present form by the same man.
		Bugge's guess that the <chapterref>Skirnismol</chapterref> was the work of the author of the <chapterref>Lokasenna</chapterref> is also possible, though it has less to support it.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Critics have generally agreed in dating the poem as we now have it as early as the first half of the tenth century; Finnur Jonsson puts it as early as 900, and claims it, as usual, for Norway.
		Doubtless it was current in Norway, in one form or another, before the first Icelandic settlements, but his argument that the thistle (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Skirnismol">31</stanzaref>) is not an Icelandic plant has little weight, for such curse-formulas must have traveled freely from place to place.
		In view of the evidence pointing to a western origin for many or all of the Eddic poems, Jonsson's reiterated “Digtet er sikkert norsk og ikke islandsk” is somewhat exasperating.
		Wherever the <chapterref>Skirnismol</chapterref> was composed, it has been preserved in exceptionally good condition, and seems to be practically devoid of interpolations or lacunæ.

			Forthwith he felt a mighty love-sickness.<br />

			<expl>Freyr</expl>: concerning his father, Njorth, and the race of the Wanes in general, cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">21</stanzaref> and note.
			Snorri thus describes Njorth's family: “Njorth begat two children in Noatun; the son was named Freyr, and the daughter Freyja; they were fair of aspect and mighty.
			Freyr is the noblest of the gods; he rules over rain and sunshine, and therewith the fruitfulness of the earth; it is well to call upon him for plenty and welfare, for he rules over wealth for mankind.
			Freyja is the noblest of the goddesses.
			When she rides to the fight, she has one-half of the slain, and Othin has half.
			When she goes on a journey, she drives her two cats, and sits in a cart.
			Love-songs please her well, and it is good to call on her in love-matters.”
			<expl>Hlithskjolf</expl>: Othin's watch-tower; cf. <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref>, introductory prose.
			<expl>He said</expl>: both manuscripts have “Then Skathi said:” (Skathi was Njorth's wife), but Bugge's emendation, based on Snorri's version, is doubtless correct.

			<expl>My son</expl>: both manuscripts, and many editors, have “our son,” which, of course, goes with the introduction of Skathi in the prose.
			As the stanza is clearly addressed to Skirnir, the change of pronouns seems justified.
			The same confusion occurs in stanza <stanzaref chapter="Skirnismol">2</stanzaref>, where Skirnir in the manuscripts is made to speak of Freyr as “your son” (plural).
			The plural pronoun in the original involves a metrical error, which is corrected by the emendation.

			Snorri's paraphrase of the poem is sufficiently close so that his addition of another sentence to Freyr's speech makes it probable that a stanza has dropped out between <stanzaref chapter="Skirnismol">7</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Skirnismol">8</stanzaref>.
			This has been tentatively reconstructed, thus:
			<textstanza>
				Hither to me<sep />shalt thou bring the maid,<br />
				And home shalt thou lead her here,<br />
				If her father wills it<sep />or wills it not,<br />
				And good reward shalt thou get.”

			<expl>The sword</expl>: Freyr's gift of his sword to Skirnir eventually proves fatal, for at the last battle, when Freyr is attacked by Beli, whom he kills bare-handed, and later when the fire-demon, Surt, slays him in turn, he is weaponless; cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">53</stanzaref> and note.
			Against the giants grim: the condition of this line makes it seem like an error in copying, and it is possible that it should be identical with the fourth line of the next stanza.

			With this stanza, bribes and threats having failed, Skirnir begins a curse which, by the power of his magic staff, is to fall on Gerth if she refuses Freyr.

			<expl>Eagle's hill</expl>: the hill at the end of heaven, and consequently overlooking hell, where the giant Hræsvelg sits “in an eagle's guise,” and makes the winds with his wings; cf. <chapterref>Vafthruthnismol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Vafthruthnismol">37</stanzaref>, also <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">50</stanzaref>.
			The second line is faulty in both manuscripts; Hildebrand's emendation corrects the error, but omits an effective touch; the manuscript line may be rendered “And look and hanker for hell.”
			The <source>Arnamagnæan Codex</source> breaks off with the fourth line of this stanza.

			The confusion noted as to the preceding stanza, and a metrical error in the third line, have led to various rearrangements and emendations; line 3 certainly looks like an interpolation.

			No gap indicated in the manuscript; Niedner makes the line here given as 4 the first half of line 3, and fills out the stanza thus:

			For the combination of this stanza with the preceding one, cf. note on stanza <stanzaref chapter="Skirnismol">35</stanzaref>.
			The scribe clearly did not consider that the stanza began with line 1, as the first word thereof in the manuscript does not begin with a capital letter and has no period before it.
			The first word of line 3, however, is so marked.
			Line 5 may well be spurious.
