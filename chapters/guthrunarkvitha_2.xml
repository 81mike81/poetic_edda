		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		It has already been pointed out (introductory note to <cr>Guthrunarkvitha I</cr>) that the tradition of Guthrun's lament was known wherever the Sigurth story existed, and that this lament was probably one of the earliest parts of the legend to assume verse form.
		Whether it reached the North as verse cannot, of course, be determined, but it is at least possible that this was the case, and in any event it is clear that by the tenth and eleventh centuries there were a number of Norse poems with Guthrun's lament as the central theme.
		Two of these are included in the Eddic collection, the second one being unquestionably much the older.
		It is evidently the poem referred to by the annotator in the prose note following the <chapterref chapter="Brot af Sigurtharkvithu">Brot</chapterref> as ``the old Guthrun lay,'' and its character and state of preservation have combined to lead most commentators to date it as early as the first half of the tenth century, whereas <cr>Guthrunarkvitha I</cr> belongs a hundred years later.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The poem has evidently been preserved in rather bad shape, with a number of serious omissions and some interpolations, but in just this form it lay before the compilers of the <src>Volsungasaga</src>, who paraphrased it faithfully, and quoted five of its stanzas.
		The interpolations are on the whole unimportant; the omissions, while they obscure the sense of certain passages, do not destroy the essential continuity of the poem, in which Guthrun reviews her sorrows from the death of Sigurth through the slaying of her brothers to Atli's dreams foretelling the death of their sons.
		It is, indeed, the only Norse poem of the Sigurth cycle antedating the year 1000 which has come down to us in anything approaching complete form; the <cr>Reginsmol</cr>, <cr>Fafnismol</cr>, and <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr> are all collections of fragments, only a short bit of the ``long'' Sigurth lay remains, and the others---<cr>Gripisspo</cr>, <cr>Guthrunarkvitha I</cr> and <chapterref chapter="Guthrunarkvitha III">III</chapterref>, <cr>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</cr>, <cr>Helreith Brynhildar</cr>, <cr>Oddrunargratr</cr>, <cr>Guthrunarhvot</cr>, <cr>Hamthesmol</cr>, and the <ref chapter="Atlakvitha">two Atli lays</ref>---are all generally dated from the eleventh and even the twelfth centuries.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		An added reason for believing that <cr>Guthrunarkvitha II</cr> traces its origin back to a lament which reached the North from Germany in verse form is the absence of most characteristic Norse additions to the narrative, except in minor details.
		Sigurth is slain in the forest, as ``German men say'' (cf. <chapterref chapter="Brot af Sigurtharkvithu">Brot</chapterref>, <proseref chapter="Brot af Sigurtharkvithu" prose="conclusion">concluding prose</proseref>); the urging of Guthrun by her mother 2nd brothers to become Atli's wife, the slaying of the Gjukungs (here only intimated, for at that point something seems to have been lost), and Guthrun's prospective revenge on Atli, all belong directly to the German tradition (cf. introductory note to <cr>Gripisspo</cr>).
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		In the <src>Codex Regius</src> the poem is entitled simply <src>Guthrunarkvitha</src>; the numeral has been added in nearly all editions to distinguish this poem from the other two Guthrun lays, and the phrase ``the old'' is borrowed from the annotator's comment in the prose note at the end of the <chapterref chapter="Brot af Sigurtharkvithu">Brot</chapterref>.

		</translation>
		<comment>
			<expl>Thjothrek</expl>: the famous Theoderich, king of the Ostrogoths, who became renowned in German story as Dietrich von Bern.
			The German tradition early accepted the anachronism of bringing together Attila (Etzel, Atli), who died in 453, and Theoderich, who was born about 455, and adding thereto Ermanarich (Jormunrek), king of the Goths, who died about 376.
			Ermanarich, in German tradition, replaced Theoderich's actual enemy, Odovakar, and it was in battle with Jormunrek (i. e., Odovakar) that Thjothrek is here said to have lost most of his men.
			The annotator found the material for this note in <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha III</chapterref>, in which Guthrun is accused of having Thjothrek as her lover.
			At the time when <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha II</chapterref> was composed (early tenth century) it is probable that the story of Theoderich had not reached the North at all, and the annotator is consequently wrong in giving the poem its setting.

			A Thora appears in <chapterref>Hyndluljoth</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hyndluljoth">18</stanzaref>, as the wife of Dag, one of the sons of Halfdan the Old, the most famous of Denmark's mythical kings, and one of her sons is Alf (Hoalf?).

		<comment>
			Lines 1--2 are probably interpolated, though the <src>Volsungasaga</src> includes the names.
			Some one apparently attempted to supply the names of Atli's messengers, the ``long-beard men'' of line 4, who have come to ask for Guthrun's hand.
			Some commentators assume, as the <src>Volsungasaga</src> does, that these messengers went with the Gjukungs to Denmark in search of Guthrun, but it seems more likely that a transitional stanza has dropped out after stanza <sr>19</sr>, and that Guthrun received Atli's emissaries in her brothers' home.
			<expl>Long-beards</expl>: the word may actually mean Langobards or Lombards, but, if it does, it is presumably without any specific significance here.
			Certainly the names in the interpolated two lines do not fit either Lombards or Huns, for Valdar is identified as a Dane, and Jarizleif and Jarizskar are apparently Slavic.
			The manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza.

			Stanzas <sr>22</sr>--<sr>25</sr> describe the draught of forgetfulness which Grimhild gives Guthrun, just as she gave one to Sigurth (in one version of the story) to make him forget Brynhild.
			The draught does not seem to work despite Guthrun's statement in stanza <sr>25</sr> (cf. stanza <sr>30</sr>), for which reason Vigfusson, not unwisely, places stanzas <sr>22</sr>--<sr>25</sr> after stanza <sr>34</sr>.

			In the manuscript, and in some editions, the first line is in the third person plural:

				Then they forgot,<sep />when the draught they had drunk.

			The second line in the original is manifestly in bad shape, and has been variously emended.
			<expl>I forgot</expl>: this emendation is doubtful, in view of stanza <sr>30</sr>, but cf. note to stanza <sr>22</sr>.
			<expl>The kings all three</expl>: probably Atli's emissaries, though the interpolated lines of stanza <sr>20</sr> name four of them.
			I suspect that line 4 is wrong, and should read:
			<textstanza class="translation">
				Ere he himself (Atli)<sep />to speak began.
			</textstanza>
			Certainly stanzas <sr>26</sr>--<sr>27</sr> fit Atli much better than they do Grimhild, and there is nothing unreasonable in Atli's having come in person, along with his tributary kings, to seek Guthrun's hand.
			However, the ``three kings'' may not be Atli's followers at all, but Gunnar, Hogni, and the unnamed third brother possibly referred to in <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">18</stanzaref>.

			This stanza is evidently Guthrun's intentionally cryptic interpretation of Atli's dreams, but the meaning of the original is more than doubtful.
			The word here rendered ``sacrifice'' may mean ``sea-catch,'' and the one rendered ``beasts'' may mean ``whales.''
			None of the attempted emendations have rendered the stanza really intelligible, but it appears to mean that Atli will soon make a sacrifice of beasts at night, and give their bodies to the people.
			Guthrun of course has in mind the slaying of his two sons.
