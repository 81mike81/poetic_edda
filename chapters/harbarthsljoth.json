            "The normal metre is the Malahattr (cf. {\\hyperref[Introduction]{General Introduction}}, where an example is given).",
            "The name of this verse-form means ``in the manner of conversation,'' and the \\eddachapterref{Harbarthsljoth's} verse fully justifies the term.",
            "The Atli poems exemplify the conventional use of Malahattr, but in the \\eddachapterref{Harbarthsljoth} the form is used with extraordinary freedom, and other metrical forms are frequently employed.",

            "I have preserved the metrical confusion of the original by keeping throughout so far as possible to the metres found in the poem; if the rhythm of the translation is often hard to catch, the difficulty is no less with the original Norse.",
            "",
            "The poem is simply a contest of abuse, such as the early Norwegian and Icelander delighted in, the opposing figures being Thor and Othin, the latter appearing in the disguise of the ferryman Harbarth.",
            "Such billingsgate lent itself readily to changes, interpolations and omissions, and it is little wonder that the poem is chaotic.",
            "It consists mainly of boasting and of references, often luckily obscure, to disreputable events in the life of one or the other of the disputants.",
            "Some editors have sought to read a complex symbolism into it, particularly by representing it as a contest between the noble or warrior class (Othin) and the peasant (Thor).",
