			The Greenland Lay of Atli

		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		There are two Atli poems in the <src>Codex Regius</src>, the <chapterref chapter="Atlakvitha">Atlakvitha (Lay of Atli)</chapterref> and the <chapterref chapter="Atlamol">Atlamol (Ballad of Atli)</chapterref>.
		The poems are not preserved or quoted in any other old manuscript, but they were extensively used by the compilers of the <src>Volsungasaga</src>.
		In the manuscript superscription to each of these poems appears the word ``Greenland,'' which has given rise to a large amount of argument.
		The scribe was by no means infallible, and in this case his statement proves no more than that in the period round 1300 there was a tradition that these two poems originated in the Greenland settlement.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The two Atli poems deal with substantially the same material: the visit of the sons of Gjuki to Atli's court, their deaths, and the subsequent revenge of their sister, Guthrun, Atli's wife, on her husband.
		The shorter of the two, the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr>, tells the story with little elaboration; the <cr>Atlamol</cr>, with about the same narrative basis, adds many details, some of them apparently of the poet's invention, and with a romantic, not to say sentimental, quality quite lacking in the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr>.
		Both poems are sharply distinguished from the rest of the collection by their metrical form, which is the Malahattr (used irregularly also in the <cr>Harbarthsljoth</cr>), employed consistently and smoothly in the <cr>Atlamol</cr>, and with a considerable mixture of what appear to be Fornyrthislag lines (cf. <ref chapter="General Introduction">Introduction</ref>) in the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr>.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		It is altogether probable that both poems belong to the eleventh century, the shorter <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> being generally dated from the first quarter thereof, and the longer <cr>Atlamol</cr> some fifty years or more later.
		In each case the poet was apparently a Christian; in the <cr>Atlamol</cr> (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Atlamol">82</stanzaref>) Guthrun expresses her readiness to die and ``go into another light,'' and in the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> there is frequent use of mythological names (e.g., Valhall, Hlithskjolf) with an evident lack of understanding of their relation to the older gods.
		These facts fit the theory of a Greenland origin exceedingly well, for the Greenland settlement grew rapidly after the first explorations of Eirik the Red, which were in 982--985, and its most flourishing period was in the eleventh century.
		The internal evidence, particularly in the case of the <cr>Atlamol</cr>, points likewise to an origin remote from Iceland, Norway, and the ``Western Isles''; and the two poems are sufficiently alike so that, despite the efforts of Finnur Jonsson and others to separate them, assigning one to Greenland and the other to Norway or else where, it seems probable that the manuscript statement is correct in both instances, and that the two Atli poems did actually originate in Greenland.
		An interesting account of this Greenland settlement is given in William Hovgaard's <src>Voyages of the Norsemen to America</src>, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1914, and an extraordinarily vivid picture of the sufferings of the early settlers appears in Maurice Hewlett's <src>Thorgils</src>, taken from the <src>Floamannasaga</src>.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		From the standpoint of narrative material there is little that is distinctively Norse in either the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> or the <cr>Atlamol</cr>.
		The story is the one outlined in the prose <cr>Drap Niflunga</cr> (largely based on these two poems), representing almost exclusively the southern blending of the Attila and Burgundian legends (cf. introductory note to <cr>Gripisspo</cr>).
		In the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr>, indeed, the word ``Burgundians'' is actually used.
		Brynhild is not mentioned in either poem; Sigurth's name appears but once, in the <cr>Atlamol</cr>.
		Thus the material goes directly back to its South-Germanic origins, with little of the Northern making-over which resulted in such extensive changes in most parts of the Sigurth story.
		The general atmosphere, on the other hand, particularly in the <cr>Atlamol</cr>, is essentially Norse.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		As has been said, the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> is metrically in a chaotic state, the normal Malahattr lines being frequently interspersed with lines and even stanzas which apparently are of the older Fornyrthislag type.
		How much of this confusion is due to faulty transmission is uncertain, but it has been suggested that the composer of the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> made over in Malahattr an older Atli poem in Fornyrthislag, and this suggestion has much to recommend it.
		That he worked on the basis of an older poem is, indeed, almost certain, for in oral prose tradition a far larger number of distinctively Norse traits would unquestionably have crept in than are found in the material of the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr>.
		As for the <cr>Atlamol</cr>, here again the poet seems to have used an older poem as his basis, possibly the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> itself, although in that case he must have had other material as well, for there are frequent divergences in such matters as proper names.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The translation of the <cr>Atlakvitha</cr> is rendered peculiarly difficult by the irregularity of the metre, by the evident faultiness of the transmission, and above all by the exceptionally large number of words found nowhere else in Old Norse, involving much guesswork as to their meanings.
		The notes do not attempt to indicate all the varying suggestions made by editors and commentators as to the reconstruction of defective stanzas and the probable meanings of obscure passages; in cases which are purely or largely guesswork the notes merely point out the uncertainty without cataloguing the proposed solutions.

		<comment>
			<expl>Gnitaheith</expl>: here the dragon Fafnir had his lair (cf. <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">11</stanzaref>).
			Sigurth doubtless owned it after Fafnir's death, and the Gjukungs after they had killed Sigurth.
			Possibly they had given it to Atli in recompense for the death of his sister, Brynhild, and he now offered to restore it to them, or---as seems more likely---the poet was not very clear about its ownership himself.
			<expl>Stems</expl>: i.e., the gilded stems of ships, carved like dragons,---an evident northern touch, if the word is correct, which is by no means certain.
			<expl>Danp</expl>: this name was early applied to a mythical Danish king (cf. <chapterref>Rigsthula</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Rigsthula">49</stanzaref> and note), but it may have been fabricated by error out of the word ``Danparstaþir'' (the phrase here used is ``staþi Danpar''), used in the <src>Hervararsaga</src> of a field of battle between the Goths and the Huns, and quite possibly referring to the region of the Dnieper.
			The name seems to have clung to the Atli tradition long after it had lost all definite significance.

			This may be the remains of two stanzas, the manuscript marks line 5 as beginning a new stanza.
			Editorial conjectures are numerous and varied.
			<expl>Household</expl>: the phrase is the same ``helms round the hearth'' commented on in stanza <sr>3</sr>.
			Some editions insert a conjectural line after line 3.
			<expl>Sword-norns</expl>, etc.: the line is exceedingly obscure, and the phrase rendered ``sword-norns'' may mean ``corpse-norns.''
			Apparently it refers to the warrior-women of the Huns, the ``shield-maids'' of line 5 and of stanza <sr>45</sr>.
			Roman writers refer to the warrior-women among the early Germanic tribes, and the tradition, closely allied to that of the Valkyries, attached itself readily to the ferocious Huns.
			<expl>Den of snakes</expl>: concerning the manner of Gunnar's death cf. <chapterref>Drap Niflunga</chapterref>.

			<expl>Merry with ale</expl>: presumably this refers to Atli, but the manuscript reading makes it apply to the two boys.
			<expl>Sharers of gold</expl>: princes.
			Line 5 is either interpolated or all that is left of a separate stanza.

		<comment>
			The text of the whole stanza has required a considerable amount of emendation.
			Lines 3--5 may have been expanded out of two lines, or line 5 may be an interpolation, possibly from stanza <stanzaref chapter="Guthrunarhvot">12</stanzaref> of the <chapterref>Guthrunarhvot</chapterref>.
			<expl>Weapons</expl>: the word literally means ``good-weaving,'' and may refer to silken garments, but this hardly fits the noun here rendered ``clashing.''
			<expl>Wept not</expl>: cf. stanza <sr>31</sr> and note.

		<comment>
			Line 1 appears to be in Fornyrthislag.
			Guthrun distributes Atli's treasures among his followers apparently to prevent their wrath at the slaying of Erp and Eitil from turning against her; Atli, as stanza <sr>43</sr> shows, is too drunk to realize or prevent what she is doing.

			The second half of line 4 is apparently an error, but none of the editorial suggestions have improved it.

			Guthrun allows the dogs and the house-thralls, who had no part in Gunnar's death, to escape before she burns the dwelling with all who are left therein.
			In <cr>Atlamol</cr>, stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Atlamol">83</stanzaref>--<stanzaref chapter="Atlamol">84</stanzaref>, Atli is slain by a son of Hogni (Hniflung?) with Guthrun's help.

		<comment>
			Some editions transfer line 2 to stanza <sr>37</sr>; others reject line 3 as interpolated.
			<expl>Myrkheim</expl> (``Dark-Home''): probably identical with Myrkwood; cf. stanza <sr>3</sr>.
			<expl>Temple</expl>: probably both here and in stanza <sr>42</sr> the word means little more than the place where Atli's treasures were kept; the poet was by no means literal in his use of terms connected with the heathen religion.
			<expl>Buthlungs</expl>: sons of Buthli, i.e., Atli and his family.
			<expl>Shield-maids</expl>: cf. stanza <sr>17</sr> and note.
