	<block class="text">
		The little <chapterref>Helreith Brynhildar</chapterref> immediately follows the “short” Sigurth lay in the <source>Codex Regius</source>, being linked to it by the brief prose note; the heading, “Brynhild's Ride on Hel-Way,” stands just before the first stanza.
		The entire poem, with the exception of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">6</stanzaref>, is likewise quoted in the <source>Nornageststhattr</source>.
		Outside of one stanza (No. <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">11</stanzaref>), which is a fairly obvious interpolation, the poem possesses an extraordinary degree of dramatic unity, and, certain pedantic commentators notwithstanding, it is one of the most vivid and powerful in the whole collection.
		None the less, it has been extensively argued that parts of it belonged originally to the so-called <chapterref>Sigrdrifumol</chapterref>.
		That it stands in close relation to this poem is evident enough, but it is difficult to believe that such a masterpiece of dramatic poetry was ever the result of mere compilation.
		It seems more reasonable to regard the <chapterref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">Helreith</chapterref>, with the exception of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">11</stanzaref> and allowing for the loss of two lines from stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">6</stanzaref>, as a complete and carefully constructed unit, based undoubtedly on older poems, but none the less an artistic creation in itself.

	<block class="text">
		The poem is generally dated as late as the eleventh century, and the concluding stanza betrays Christian influence almost unmistakably.
		It shows the confusion of traditions manifest in all the later poems; for example, Brynhild is here not only a Valkyrie but also a swan-maiden. Only three stanzas have any reference to the Guthrun-Gunnar part of the story; otherwise the poem is concerned solely with the episode of Sigurth's finding the sleeping Valkyrie.
		Late as it is, therefore, it is essentially a Norse creation, involving very few of the details of the German cycle (cf. introductory note to <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>).

			After the death of Brynhild there were made two bale-fires, the one for Sigurth, and that burned first, and on the other was Brynhild burned, and she was on a wagon which was covered with a rich cloth.<br />
			Thus it is told, that Brynhild went in the wagon on Hel-way, and passed by a house where dwelt a certain giantess.<br />

			The prose follows the last stanza of <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref> without break.
			<expl>Two bale-fires</expl>: this contradicts the statement made in the concluding stanzas of <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref>, that Sigurth and Brynhild were burned on the same pyre; there is no evidence that the annotator here had anything but his own mistaken imagination to go on.

			In <source>Regius</source> these two lines stand after stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">7</stanzaref>, but most editions; place them as here.
			They are not quoted in the <source>Nornageststhattr</source>.
			Presumably two lines, and perhaps more, have been lost.
			It has frequently been argued that all or part of the passage from stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">6</stanzaref> through stanza <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">10</stanzaref> (<stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">6</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">10</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">7</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">10</stanzaref> or <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">8</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">10</stanzaref>) comes originally from the so-called <chapterref>Sigrdrifumol</chapterref>, where it would undoubtedly fit exceedingly well.
			<expl>Hild</expl>: a Valkyrie name meaning “Fighter” (cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">31</stanzaref>).
			In such compound names as Brynhild (“Fighter in Armor”) the first element was occasionally omitted.
			<expl>Hlymdalir</expl> (“Tumult-Dale”): a mythical name, merely signifying the place of battle as the home of Valkyries.

			Regarding the identification of swan-maidens with Valkyries, and the manner in which men could get them in their power by stealing their swan-garments, cf. <chapterref>Völundarkvitha</chapterref>, <proseref chapter="Völundarkvitha" prose="p1">introductory prose</proseref> and note, where the same thing happens.
			<expl>The monarch</expl>: perhaps Agnar, brother of Autha, mentioned in <chapterref>Sigrdrifumol</chapterref> (<proseref chapter="Sigrdrifumol" prose="p5_1">prose and quoted verse following stanza 4</proseref>) as the warrior for whose sake Brynhild defied Othin in slaying Hjalmgunnar.

		<comment>
			This stanza is presumably an interpolation, reflecting a different version of the story, wherein Sigurth meets Brynhild at the home of her brother-in-law and foster-father, Heimir (cf. <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">19</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">27</stanzaref>).
			<expl>Grani</expl>: Sigurth's horse.
			<expl>Danes</expl>: nowhere else does Sigurth appear in this capacity.
			Perhaps this is a curious relic of the Helgi tradition.

			<expl>Eight nights</expl>: elsewhere (cf. <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">42</stanzaref>) the time is stated as three nights, not eight.
			There is a confusion of traditions here, as in <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>.
			In the version of the story wherein Sigurth met Brynhild before he encountered the Gjukungs, Sigurth was bound by no oaths, and the union was completed; it is only in the alternative version that the episode of the sword laid between the two occurs.

			The idea apparently conveyed in the concluding lines, that Sigurth and Brynhild will be together in some future life, is utterly out of keeping with the Norse pagan traditions, and the whole stanza indicates the influence of Christianity.
