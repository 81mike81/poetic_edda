	<block class="text">
		The so-called <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr>, which immediately follows the <cr>Fafnismol</cr> in the <src>Codex Regius</src> without any indication of a break, and without separate title, is unquestionably the most chaotic of all the poems in the Eddic collection.
		The end of it has been entirely lost, for the fifth folio of eight sheets is missing from <src>Regius</src>, the gap coming after the first line of stanza <sr>29</sr> of this poem.
		That stanza has been completed, and eight more have been added, from much later paper manuscripts, but even so the conclusion of the poem is in obscurity.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Properly speaking, however, the strange conglomeration of stanzas which the compiler of the collection has left for us, and which, in much the same general form, seems to have lain before the authors of the <src>Volsungasaga</src>, in which eighteen of its stanzas are quoted, is not a poem at all.
		Even its customary title is an absurd error.
		The mistake made by the annotator in thinking that the epithet ``sigrdrifa,'' rightly applied to Brynhild as a ``bringer of victory,'' was a proper name has already been explained and commented on (note on <cr>Fafnismol</cr>, <stanzaref chapter="Fafnismol">44</stanzaref>).
		Even if the collection of stanzas were in any real sense a poem, which it emphatically is not, it is certainly not the ``Ballad of Sigrdrifa'' which it is commonly called.
		``Ballad of Brynhild'' would be a sufficiently suitable title, and I have here brought the established name ``Sigrdrifumol'' into accord with this by translating the epithet instead of treating it as a proper name.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Even apart from the title, however, the <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr> has little claim to be regarded as a distinct poem, nor is there any indication that the compiler did so regard it.
		Handicapped as we are by the loss of the concluding section, and of the material which followed it on those missing pages, we can yet see that the process which began with the prose <cr>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</cr>, and which, interrupted by the insertion of the <cr>Gripisspo</cr>, went on through the <cr>Reginsmol</cr> and the <cr>Fafnismol</cr>, continued through as much of the <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr> as is left to us.
		In other words, the compiler told the story of Sigurth in mixed prose and verse, using whatever verse he could find without much questioning as to its origin, and filling in the gaps with hii own prose.
		<cr>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</cr>, <cr>Reginsmol</cr>, <cr>Fafnismol</cr>, and <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr> are essentially a coherent unit, but one of the compiler's making only; they represent neither one poem nor three distinct poems, and the divisions and titles which have been almost universally adopted by editors are both arbitrary and misleading.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr> section as we now have it is an extraordinary piece of patchwork.
		It is most unlikely that the compiler himself brought all these fragments together for the first time; little by little, through a process of accretion and also, unluckily, through one of elimination, the material grew into its present shape.
		Certainly the basis of it is a poem dealing with the finding of Brynhild by Sigurth, but of this original poem only five stanzas (<sr>2</sr>--<sr>4</sr> and <sr>20</sr>--<sr>21</sr>) can be identified with any degree of confidence.
		To these five stanzas should probably, however, be added some, if not all, of the passage (stanzas <sr>6</sr>--<sr>12</sr>) in which Brynhild teaches Sigurth the magic runes.
		These stanzas of rune-lore attracted sundry similar passages from other sources, including stanza <sr>5</sr>, in which a magic draught is administered (not necessarily by Brynhild or to Sigurth), the curious rune-chant in stanzas <sr>15</sr>--<sr>17</sr>, and stanzas <sr>13</sr>--<sr>14</sr> and <sr>18</sr>--<sr>19</sr>.
		Beginning with stanza <sr>22</sr>, and running to the end of the fragment (stanza <sr>37</sr>), is a set of numbered counsels closely resembling the <src>Loddfafnismol</src> (<cr>Hovamol</cr>, stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">111</stanzaref>--<stanzaref chapter="Hovamol">138</stanzaref>), which manifestly has nothing whatever to do with Brynhild.
		Even in this passage there are probably interpolations (stanzas <sr>25</sr>, <sr>27</sr>, <sr>30</sr>, <sr>34</sr>, and <sr>36</sr>).
		Finally, and bespeaking the existence at some earlier time of another Sigurth-Brynhild poem, is stanza <sr>1</sr>, sharply distinguished by its metrical form from stanzas <sr>2</sr>--<sr>4</sr> and <sr>20</sr>--<sr>21</sr>.
		Many critics argue that stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynildar">6</stanzaref>--<stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynildar">10</stanzaref> of <cr>Helreith Brynildar</cr> belonged originally to the same poem as stanza <sr>1</sr> of the <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr>.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr>, then, must be regarded simply as a collection of fragments, most of them originally having no relation to the main subject.
		All of the story, the dialogue and the characterization are embodied in stanzas <sr>1</sr>--<sr>4</sr> and <sr>20</sr>--<sr>21</sr> and in the prose notes accompanying the first four stanzas; all of the rest might equally well (or better) be transferred to the <cr>Hovamol</cr>, where its character entitles it to a place.
		Yet stanzas <sr>2</sr>--<sr>4</sr> are as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry, and it is out of the scanty material of these three stanzas that Wagner constructed much of the third act of ``Siegfried.''
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Sigrdrifumol</cr> represents almost exclusively the contributions of the North to the Sigurth tradition (cf. introductory note to the <cr>Gripisspo</cr>).
		Brynhild, here disguised by the annotator as ``Sigrdrifa,'' appears simply as a battle-maid and supernatural dispenser of wisdom; there is no trace of the daughter of Buthli and the rival of Guthrun.
		There is, however, so little of the ``poem'' which can definitely be assigned to the Sigurth cycle that it is impossible to trace back any of the underlying narrative substance.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The nature and condition of the material have made editorial conjectures and emendations very numerous, and as most of the guesses are neither conclusive nor particularly important, only a few of their are mentioned in the notes.

			The introductory prose follows without break the prose concluding the <chapterref>Fafnismol</chapterref>, the point of division being arbitrary and not agreed upon by all editors.
			<expl>Hindarfjoll</expl>: cf. <chapterref>Fafnismol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Fafnismol">42</stanzaref> and note.
			<expl>Franks</expl>: this does not necessarily mean that Sigurth was on his way to the Gjukungs' home, for Sigmund had a kingdom in the land of the Franks (cf. <chapterref>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</chapterref>).
			<expl>Shields</expl>: the annotator probably drew the notion of the shield-tower from the reference in <chapterref>Helreith Brynhildar</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">9</stanzaref>.
			The flame-girt tower was not uncommon; cf. Mengloth's hall in <chapterref>Svipdagsmol</chapterref>.

			This stanza is clearly in bad shape; perhaps, as the manuscript indicates, a new stanza, of which most has been lost, should begin with line 3.
			<expl>Brimir</expl>: a giant (cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">9</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">37</stanzaref>); why Othin should have his sword is unknown.

			<expl>Hrungnir</expl>: the slayer of the giant Hrungnir was Thor (cf. <chapterref>Harbarthsljoth</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Harbarthsljoth">14</stanzaref> and note), but the line is in bad shape; the name may not be Hrungnir, and ``killer'' is a conjectural addition.

			It is quite possible that the original poem concluded with two stanzas after this, paraphrased thus in the <src>Volsungasaga</src>:
			``Sigurth said: `Nowhere is to be found any one wiser than thou, and this I swear, that I shall have thee for mine, and that thou art after my heart's desire.'
			She answered: `I would rather have thee though I might choose among all men.'
			And this they bound between them with oaths.''
			Stanzas <sr>22</sr>--<sr>37</sr>, which the <src>Volsungasaga</src> paraphrases, may have been introduced at a relatively early time, but can hardly have formed part of the original poem.

			Lines 3--4 may well have come from the old Sigurth-Brynhild poem, like stanzas <sr>2</sr>--<sr>4</sr> and <sr>20</sr>--<sr>21</sr>, being inserted here, where they do not fit particularly well, in place of the two lines with which the eleventh counsel originally ended.
			Perhaps they formed part of the stanza of warning which evidently preceded Brynhild's speech in stanza <sr>20</sr>.
			In the Volsungasaga they are paraphrased at the end of Brynhild's long speech of advice (stanzas <sr>20</sr>--<sr>37</sr>), and are immediately followed by the prose passage given in the note on stanza <sr>21</sr>.
			It seems likely, therefore, that the paper manuscripts have preserved all of the so-called <chapterref>Sigrdrifumol</chapterref> which was contained in the lost section of <src>Regius</src>, with the possible exception of these two concluding stanzas, and these may very well have been given only in the form of a prose note, though it is practically certain that at one time they existed in verse form.
