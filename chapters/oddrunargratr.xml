		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The <chapterref>Oddrunargratr</chapterref> follows <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha III</chapterref> in the <source>Codex Regius</source>; it is not quoted or mentioned elsewhere, except that the composer of the <ref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">“short” Sigurth lay</ref> seems to have been familiar with it.
		The <source>Volsungasaga</source> says nothing of the story on which it is based, and mentions Oddrun only once, in the course of its paraphrase of Brynhild's prophecy from the <ref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">“short” Sigurth lay</ref>.
		That the poem comes from the eleventh century is generally agreed; prior to the year 1000 there is no trace of the figure of Oddrun, Atli's sister, and yet the <chapterref>Oddrunargratr</chapterref> is almost certainly older than the <ref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">“short” Sigurth lay</ref>, so that the last half of the eleventh century seems to be a fairly safe guess.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Where or how the figure of Oddrun entered the Sigurth-Atli cycle is uncertain.
		She does not appear in any of the extant German versions, and it is generally assumed that she was a creation of the North, though the poet refers to “old tales” concerning her.
		She does not directly affect the course of the story at all, though the poet has used effectively the episode of Gunnar's death, with the implication that Atli's vengeance on Gunnar and Hogni was due, at least in part, to his discovery of Gunnar's love affair with Oddrun.
		The material which forms the background of Oddrun's story belongs wholly to the German part of the legend (cf. introductory note to <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>), and is paralleled with considerable closeness in the <source>Nibelungenlied</source>; only Oddrun herself and the subsidiary figures of Borgny and Vilmund are Northern additions.
		The geography, on the other hand, is so utterly chaotic as to indicate that the original localization of the Atli story had lost all trace of significance by the time this poem was composed.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		In the manuscript the poem, or rather the brief introductory prose note, bears the heading “Of Borgny and Oddrun,” but nearly all editions, following late paper manuscripts, have given the poem the title it bears here.
		Outside of a few apparently defective stanzas, and some confusing transpositions, the poem has clearly been preserved in good condition, and the beginning and end are definitely marked.

			Heithrek was the name of a king, whose daughter was called Borgny.<br />
			Vilmund was the name of the man who was her lover.<br />
			She could not give birth to a child until Oddrun, Atli's sister, had come to her; Oddrun had been beloved of Gunnar, son of Gjuki.<br />
			About this story is the following poem.

			Nothing further is known of <expl>Heithrek</expl>, <expl>Borgny</expl> or <expl>Vilmund</expl>.
			The annotator has added the name of Borgny's father, but otherwise his material comes from the poem itself.
			<expl>Oddrun</expl>, sister of Atli and Brynhild, here appears as proficient in birth-runes (cf. <chapterref>Sigrdrifumol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Sigrdrifumol">8</stanzaref>).

		<comment>
			<expl>Olden tales</expl>: this may be merely a stock phrase, or it may really mean that the poet found his story in oral prose tradition.
			<expl>Morningland</expl>: the poem's geography is utterly obscure.
			“Morningland” is apparently identical with “Hunland” (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">4</stanzaref>), and yet Oddrun is herself sister of the king of the Huns.
			Vigfusson tries to make “Mornaland” into “Morva land” and explain it as Moravia.
			Probably it means little more than a country lying vaguely in the East.
			With stanza <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">28</stanzaref> the confusion grows worse.

			In stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">16</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">17</stanzaref> the underlying story seems to be the one used in <chapterref>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</chapterref> (particularly stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">32</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr" chpater="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">39</stanzaref>), and referred to in <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha I</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Guthrunarkvitha I">24</stanzaref>, wherein Gunnar and Sigurth lay siege to Atli's city (it here appears as Brynhild's) and are bought off only by Atli's giving Brynhild to Gunnar as wife, winning her consent thereto by falsely representing to her that Gunnar is Sigurth.
			This version is, of course, utterly at variance with the one in which Sigurth wins Brynhild for Gunnar by riding through the ring of flames, and is probably more closely akin to the early German traditions.
			In the <source>Nibelungenlied</source> Brynhild appears as a queen ruling over lands and peoples.

			In the manuscript lines 1–2 of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">15</stanzaref> follow line 2, resulting in various conjectural combinations.
			The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza.
			<expl>Rings</expl>, etc.: possibly, as Gering maintains, payment offered by Gunnar and Hogni for Brynhild's death, but more probably, as in stanza <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">20</stanzaref>, Gunnar's proffered “marriage gold” for the hand of Oddrun.

			<expl>Murky wood</expl>: the forest which divided Atli's realm from that of the Gjukungs is in <chapterref>Atlakvitha</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Atlakvitha">3</stanzaref>, called Myrkwood.

		<comment>
			In the manuscript the three lines of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">27</stanzaref> follow line 2, and line 3 is marked as beginning a new stanza.
			<expl>Geirmund</expl>: nothing further is known of him, but he seems to be an ally or retainer of Atli, or possibly his brother.
			<expl>Hlesey</expl>: the poet's geography is here in very bad shape.
			Hlesey is (or may be) the Danish island of Läsö, in the Kattegat (cf. <chapterref>Harbarthsljoth</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Harbarthsljoth">37</stanzaref> and note), and thither he has suddenly transported not only Gunnar's death-place but Atli's whole dwelling (cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">29</stanzaref>), despite his previous references to the ride to Hunland (stanzas 3–4) and the “murky wood” (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">23</stanzaref>).
			Geirmund's home, where Oddrun has gone, is separated from Hlesey and Atli's dwelling by a sound (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Oddrunargratr">29</stanzaref>).
			However, geographical accuracy is seldom to be looked for in heroic epic poetry.

			The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza.
			<expl>Atli's mother</expl>: the <source>Volsungasaga</source> does not follow this version; Gunnar puts all the serpents but one to sleep with his harp playing, “but a mighty and evil adder crawled to him and drove his fangs into him till they reached his heart, and so he died.”
			It is possible that “Atli” is a scribal error for a word meaning “of serpents.”
