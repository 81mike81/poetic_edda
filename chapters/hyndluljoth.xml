		<section>Introductory Note</section>

	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Hyndluljoth</cr> is found in neither of the great manuscripts of the <src>Poetic Edda</src>, but is included in the so-called <src>Flateyjarbok</src> (Book of the Flat Island), an enormous compilation made somewhere about 1400.
		The lateness of this manuscript would of itself be enough to cast a doubt upon the condition in which the poem has been preserved, and there can be no question that what we have of it is in very poor shape.
		It is, in fact, two separate poems, or parts of them, clumsily put together.
		The longer one, the <src>Poem of Hyndla</src> proper, is chiefly a collection of names, not strictly mythological but belonging to the semi-historical hero-sagas of Norse tradition.
		The wise-woman, Hyndla, being asked by Freyja to trace the ancestry of her favorite, Ottar, for the purpose of deciding a wager, gives a complex genealogy including many of the heroes who appear in the popular sagas handed down from days long before the Icelandic settlements.
		The poet was learned, but without enthusiasm; it is not likely that he composed the <cr>Hyndluljoth</cr> much before the twelfth century, though the material of which it is compounded must have been very much older.
		Although the genealogies are essentially continental, the poem seems rather like a product of the archæological period of Iceland.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Inserted bodily in the <cr>Hyndluljoth</cr> proper is a fragment of fifty-one lines, taken from a poem of which, by a curious chance, we know the name.
		Snorri quotes one stanza of it, calling it ``the short <cr>Voluspo</cr>.''
		The fragment preserved gives, of course, no indication of the length of the original poem, but it shows that it was a late and very inferior imitation of the great <cr>Voluspo</cr>.
		Like the <cr>Hyndluljoth</cr> proper, it apparently comes from the twelfth century; but there is nothing whatever to indicate that the two poems were the work of the same man, or were ever connected in any way until some blundering copyist mixed them up.
		Certainly the connection did not exist in the middle of the thirteenth century, when Snorri quoted ``the short <cr>Voluspo</cr>.''
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Neither poem is of any great value, either as mythology or as poetry.
		The author of ``the short <cr>Voluspo</cr>'' seems, indeed, to have been more or less confused as to his facts; and both poets were too late to feel anything of the enthusiasm of the earlier school.
		The names of Hyndla's heroes, of course, suggest an unlimited number of stories, but as most of these have no direct relation to the poems of the Edda, I have limited the notes to a mere record of who the persons mentioned were, and the saga-groups in which they appeared.

			<expl>Freyja</expl>: The names of the speakers do not appear in the manuscripts.

			As stanzas <sr>9</sr>--<sr>10</sr> show, Ottar has made a wager of his entire inheritance with Angantyr regarding the relative loftiness of their ancestry, and by rich offerings (Hyndla hints at less commendable methods) has induced Freyja to assist him in establishing his genealogy.
			Freyja, having turned Ottar for purposes of disguise into a boar, calls on the giantess <expl>Hyndla</expl> (``She-Dog'') to aid her.
			Hyndla does not appear elsewhere in the poems.

			Sigmund alone was able to draw from the tree the sword which a mysterious stranger (Othin, of course) had thrust into it (compare the first act of Wagner's <src>Die Walküre</src>).

			Some editors, following Simrock, assign this whole stanza to Hyndla; others assign to her lines 3--4.
			Giving the entire stanza to Freyja makes better sense than any other arrangement, but is dependent on changing the manuscript's ``thy'' in line 3 to ``my'', as suggested by Bugge.
			The boar on which Freyja rides (``my worthy steed'') is, of course, Ottar.

			Hyndla detects Ottar, and accuses Freyja of having her lover with her.
			Unless Ottar is identical with Oth (cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">25</stanzaref> and note), which seems most unlikely, there is no other reference to this love affair.

			Possibly two stanzas, or perhaps one with interpolations.

			<expl>Skjoldungs</expl>: the descendants of Skjold, a mythical king who was Othin's son and the ancestor of the Danish kings; cf. <src>Snorri's Edda</src>, <src>Skaldskaparmal</src>, 43.

			<expl>Othlings</expl>: Snorri derives this race from Authi, the son of Halfdan the Old (cf. stanza <sr>14</sr>).
			<expl>Ylfings</expl>: some editors have changed this to ``Ynglings,'' as in stanza <sr>16</sr>, referring to the descendants of Yng or Yngvi, another son of Halfdan, but the reference may be to the same mythical family to which Helgi Hundingsbane belonged (cf. <chapterref>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I">5</stanzaref>).

			<expl>Halfdan</expl> the Old, a mythical king of Denmark, called by Snorri ``the most famous of all kings,'' of whom it was foretold that ``for three hundred years there should be no woman and no man in his line who was not of great repute.''
			After the slaying of Sigtrygg he married Almveig (or Alvig), daughter of King Eymund of Holmgarth (i.e., Russia), who bore him eighteen sons, nine at one birth.

			An isolated stanza, which some editors place after stanza <sr>24</sr>, others combining lines 1--2 with the fragmentary stanza <sr>23</sr> In the manuscript lines 3--4 stand after stanza <sr>24</sr>, where they fail to connect clearly with anything.
			<expl>Hrolf the Old</expl>: probably King Hrolf Gautreksson of Gautland, in the saga relating to whom (<src>Fornaldar sögur</src> III, 57 ff.) appear the names of Thorir the iron-shield and Grim Thorkelsson.

			Stanzas <sr>23</sr> and <sr>24</sr> name the twelve Berserkers, the sons of Arngrim and Eyfura, the story of whom is told in the <src>Hervararsaga</src> and the <src>Orvar-Oddssaga</src>.
			Saxo Grammaticus tells of the battle between them and Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd.
			Line 1 does not appear in the manuscript, but is added from the list of names given in the sagas.
			The Berserkers were wild warriors, distinguished above all by the fits of frenzy to which they were subject in battle; during these fits they howled like wild beasts, foamed at the mouth, and gnawed the iron rims of their shields.
			At such times they were proof against steel or fire, but when the fever abated they were weak.
			The etymology of the word <emph>berserk</emph> is disputed; probably, however, it means ``bear-shirt.''

			<expl>Heithrun</expl>: the she-goat that stands by Valhall (cf. <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">25</stanzaref>), the name being here used simply of she-goats in general, in caustic comment on Freyja's morals.
			Of these Loki entertained a similar view; cf. <chapterref>Lokasenna</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Lokasenna">30</stanzaref>.

			<expl>Oth</expl>: cf. stanza <sr>6</sr> and note, and <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">25</stanzaref> and note.
			Lines 3--4, abbreviated in the manuscript, are very likely repeated here by mistake.

			The manuscript repeats once again lines 3--4 of stanza <sr>47</sr> as the last two lines of this stanza.
			It seems probable that two lines have been lost, to the effect that Freyja will burn the giantess alive
