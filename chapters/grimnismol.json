            "In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them followed a narrative sequence of ideas.",
            "The stories themselves appear to have lived in oral prose tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition.",
