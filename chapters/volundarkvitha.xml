	<block class="text">
		Between the <cr>Thrymskvitha</cr> and the <cr>Alvissmol</cr> in the <src>Codex Regius</src> stands the <cr>Völundarkvitha</cr>.
		It was also included in the <src>Arnamagnæan Codex</src>, but unluckily it begins at the very end of the fragment which has been preserved, and thus only a few lines of the opening prose remain.
		This is doubly regrettable because the text in <src>Regius</src> is unquestionably in very bad shape, and the other manuscript would doubtless have been of great assistance in the reconstruction of the poem.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		There has been a vast amount written regarding the Weland tradition as a whole, discussing particularly the relations between the <cr>Völundarkvitha</cr> and the Weland passage in <src>Deor's Lament</src>.
		There can be little question that the story came to the North from Saxon regions, along with many of the other early hero tales.
		In stanza <sr>16</sr> the Rhine is specifically mentioned as the home of treasure; and the presence of the story in Anglo-Saxon poetry probably as early as the first part of the eighth century proves beyond a doubt that the legend cannot have been a native product of Scandinavia.
		In one form or another, however, the legend of the smith persisted for centuries throughout all the Teutonic lands, and the name of Wayland Smith is familiar to all readers of Walter Scott, and even of Rudyard Kipling's tales of England.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		In what form this story reached the North is uncertain.
		Sundry striking parallels between the diction of the <cr>Völundarkvitha</cr> and that of the Weland passage in <src>Deor's Lament</src> make it distinctly probable that a Saxon song on this subject had found its way to Scandinavia or Iceland.
		But the prose introduction to the poem mentions the ``old sagas'' in which Völund was celebrated, and in the <src>Thithrekssaga</src> we have definite evidence of the existence of such prose narrative in the form of the <src>Velentssaga</src> (Velent, Völund, Weland, and Wayland all being, of course, identical), which gives a long story for which the <cr>Völundarkvitha</cr> can have supplied relatively little, if any, of the material.
		It is probable, then, that Weland stories were current in both prose and verse in Scandinavia as early as the latter part of the ninth century.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Once let a figure become popular in oral tradition, and the number and variety of the incidents connected with his name will increase very rapidly.
		Doubtless there were scores of Weland stories current in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, many of them with very little if any traditional authority.
		The main one, however, the story of the laming of the smith by King Nithuth (or by some other enemy) and of Weland's terrible revenge, forms the basis of the <cr>Völundarkvitha</cr>.
		To this, by way of introduction, has been added the story of Völund and the wan-maiden, who, to make things even more complex, is likewise aid to be a Valkyrie.
		Some critics maintain that these two sections were originally two distinct poems, merely strung together by the compiler with the help of narrative prose links; but the poem as a whole has a kind of dramatic unity which suggests rather that an early poet---for linguistically the poem belongs among the oldest of the Eddic collection---used two distinct legends, whether in prose or verse, as the basis for the composition of a new and homogeneous poem.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The swan-maiden story appears, of course, in many places quite distinct from the Weland tradition, and, in another form, became one of the most popular of German folk tales.
		Like the story of Weland, however, it is of German rather than Scandinavian origin, and the identification of the swan-maidens as Valkyries, which may have taken place before the legend reached the North, may, on the other hand, have been simply an attempt to connect southern tradition with figures well known in northern mythology.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Völundarkvitha</cr> is full of prose narrative links, including an introduction.
		The nature of such prose links has already been discussed in the introductory note to the <cr>Grimnismol</cr>; the <cr>Völundarkvitha</cr> is a striking illustration of the way in which the function of the earlier Eddic verse was limited chiefly to dialogue or description, the narrative outline being provided, if at all, in prose.
		This prose was put in by each reciter according to his fancy and knowledge, and his estimate of his hearers' need for such explanations; some of it, as in this instance, eventually found its way into the written record.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The manuscript of the <cr>Völundarkvitha</cr> is in such bad shape, and the conjectural emendations have been so numerous, that in the notes I have attempted to record only the most important of them.

		<translation>
			There was a king in Sweden named Nithuth.<br />
			He had two sons and one daughter; her name was Bothvild.<br />
			There were three brothers, sons of a king of the Finns: one was called Slagfith, another Egil, the third Völund.<br />
			They went on snowshoes and hunted wild beasts.<br />
			They came into Ulfdalir and there they built themselves a house; there was a lake there which is called Ulfsjar.<br />
			Early one morning they found on the shore of the lake three women, who were spinning flax.<br />
			Near them were their swan garments, for they were Valkyries.<br />
			Two of them were daughters of King Hlothver, Hlathguth the Swan-White and Hervor the All-Wise, and the third was Olrun, daughter of Kjar from Valland.<br />
			These did they bring home to their hall with them.<br />
			Egil took Olrun, and Slagfith Swan-White, and Völund All-Wise.<br />
			There they dwelt seven winters; but then they flew away to find battles, and came back no more.<br />
			Then Egil set forth on his snowshoes to follow Olrun, and Slagfith followed Swan White, but Völund stayed in Ulfdalir.<br />
			He was a most skillful man, as men know from old tales.<br />
			King Nithuth had him taken by force, as the poem here tells.
		</translation>
		<comment>
			<expl>Nithuth</expl> (``Bitter Hater''): here identified as a king of Sweden, is in the poem (stanzas <sr>9</sr>, <sr>15</sr> and <sr>32</sr>) called lord of the Njars, which may refer to the people of the Swedish district of Nerike.
			In any case, the scene of the story has moved from Saxon lands into the Northeast.
			The first and last sentences of the introduction refer to the second part of the poem; the rest of it concerns the swan-maidens episode.
			<expl>Bothvild</expl> (``Warlike Maid''): Völund's victim in the latter part of the poem.
			<expl>King of the Finns</expl>: this notion, clearly later than the poem, which calls Völund an elf, may perhaps be ascribed to the annotator who composed the prose introduction.
			The Finns, meaning the dwellers in Lapland, were generally credited with magic powers.
			Egil appears in the <src>Thithrekssaga</src> as Völund's brother, but Slagfith is not elsewhere mentioned.
			<expl>Ulfdalir</expl> (``Wolf-Dale''), <expl>Ulfsjar</expl> (``Wolf-Sea''), <expl>Valland</expl> (``Slaughter-Land''): mythical places without historical identification.
			<expl>Valkyries</expl>: cf. <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">31</stanzaref> and note; there is nothing in the poem to identify the three swan maidens as Valkyries except one obscure word in line 2 of stanza <sr>1</sr> and again in line 5 of stanza <sr>5</sr>, which may mean, as Gering translates it, ``helmed,'' or else ``fair and wise.''
			I suspect that the annotator, anxious to give the Saxon legend as much northern local color as possible, was mistaken in his mythology, and that the poet never conceived of his swan-maidens as Valkyries at all.
			However, this identification of swan-maidens with Valkyries was not uncommon; cf. <chapterref>Helreith Brynhildar</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Helreith Brynhildar">7</stanzaref>.
			The three maidens' names, <expl>Hlathguth</expl>, <expl>Hervor</expl>, and <expl>Olrun</expl>, do not appear in the lists of Valkyries.
			<expl>King Hlothver</expl>: this name suggests the southern origin of the story, as it is the northern form of Ludwig; the name appears again in <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha II</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Guthrunarkvitha II">26</stanzaref>, and that of <expl>Kjar</expl> is found in <chapterref chapter="Atlakvitha en Grönlenzka">Atlakvitha</cr>, <stanzaref chapter="Atlakvitha en Grönlenzka">7</stanzaref>, both of these poems being based on German stories.
			It is worth noting that the composer of this introductory note seems to have had little or no information beyond what was actually contained in the poem as it has come down to us; he refers to the ``old stories'' about Völund, but either he was unfamiliar with them in detail or else he thought it needless to make use of them.
			His note simply puts in clear and connected form what the verse tells somewhat obscurely; his only additions are making Nithuth a king of Sweden and Völund's father a king of the Finns, supplying the name Ulfsjar for the lake, identifying the swan-maidens as Valkyries, and giving Kjar a home in Valland.

		<comment>
			The manuscript definitely assigns this stanza to Völund, but many editors give the first two lines to Nithuth.
			In the manuscript stanza <sr>16</sr> is followed by the two lines of stanza 2, and many editions make of lines 3--4 of stanza <sr>16</sr> and stanza <sr>2</sr> a single speech by Völund.
			<expl>Grani's way</expl>: Grani was Sigurth's horse, on which he rode to slay Fafnir and win Andvari's hoard; this and the reference to the <expl>Rhine</expl> as the home of wealth betray the southern source of the story.
			If lines 1--2 belong to Völund, they mean that Nithuth got his wealth in the Rhine country, and that Völund's hoard has nothing to do with it; if the speaker is Nithuth, they mean that Völund presumably has not killed a dragon, and that he is far from the wealth of the Rhine, so that he must have stolen his treasure from Nithuth himself.

			Line 1 is lacking in the manuscript, lines 2--4 following immediately after the two lines here given as stanza <sr>2</sr>.
			Line 1, borrowed from line 1 of stanza <sr>32</sr>, is placed here by many editors, following Bugge's suggestion.
			Certainly it is Nithuth's wife who utters line 4.
			<expl>Who comes from the wood</expl>: Völund, noted as a hunter.
			Gering assumes that with the entrance of Nithuth's wife the scene has changed from Völund's house to Nithuth's, but I cannot see that this is necessary.

			Editors have rejected various lines, and some have regrouped the last lines with the first two of stanza <sr>20</sr>.
			The elimination of the passages in parenthesis produces a four-line stanza which is metrically correct, but it has little more than guesswork to support it.

			Something has probably been lost before this stanza, explaining how Völund made himself wings, as otherwise, owing to his lameness, he could not leave the island.
			The <src>Thithrekssaga</src> tells the story of how Völund's brother, Egil, shot birds and gave him the feathers, out of which he made a feather-garment.
			This break in the narrative illustrates the lack of knowledge apparently possessed by the compiler who was responsible for the prose notes; had he known the story told in the <src>Thithrekssaga</src>, it is hardly conceivable that he would have failed to indicate the necessary connecting link at this point.
			Some editors reject line 3 as spurious.

			The first line is a conjectural addition.
			<expl>Thakkrath</expl> is probably the northern form of the Middle High German name Dancrat.

			The manuscript does not name the speaker.
			Different editors have rejected one or another of the last three lines, and as the manuscript indicates line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, the loss of two or three lines has likewise been suggested.
			According to the <src>Thithrekssaga</src>, the son of Völund and Bothvild was Vithga, or Witege, one of the heroes of Dietrich of Bern.
