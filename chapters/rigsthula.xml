<chapter english_name="Rigsthula" icelandic_name="Ri`gsÃ¾ula" translation="The Song of Rig">
	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Rigsthula</cr> is found in neither of the principal codices.
		The only manuscript containing it is the so-called <src>Codex Wormanius</src>, a manuscript of Snorri's <src>Prose Edda</src>.
		The poem appears on the last sheet of this manuscript, which unluckily is incomplete, and thus the end of the poem is lacking.
		In the <src>Codex Wormanius</src> itself the poem has no title, but a fragmentary parchment included with it calls the poem the <cr>Rigsthula</cr>.
		Some late paper manuscripts give it the title of <src>Rigsmol</src>.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The <cr>Rigsthula</cr> is essentially unlike anything else which editors have agreed to include in the so-called <src>Edda</src>.
		It is a definitely cultural poem, explaining, on a mythological basis, the origin of the different castes of early society: the thralls, the peasants, and the warriors.
		From the warriors, finally, springs one who is destined to become a king, and thus the whole poem is a song in praise of the royal estate.
		This fact in itself would suffice to indicate that the <cr>Rigsthula</cr> was not composed in Iceland, where for centuries kings were regarded with profound disapproval.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Not only does the <cr>Rigsthula</cr> praise royalty, but it has many of the earmarks of a poem composed in praise of a particular king.
		The manuscript breaks off at a most exasperating point, just as the connection between the mythical ``Young Kon'' (Konr ungr, konungr, ``king''; but cf. stanza <sr>44</sr>, note) and the monarch in question is about to be established.
		Owing to the character of the Norse settlements in Iceland, Ireland, and the western islands generally, search for a specific king leads back to either Norway or Denmark; despite the arguments advanced by Edzardi, Vigfusson, Powell, and others, it seems most improbable that such a poem should have been produced elsewhere than on the Continent, the region where Scandinavian royalty most flourished.
		Finnur Jonsson's claim for Norway, with Harald the Fair-Haired as the probable king in question, is much less impressive than Mogk's ingenious demonstration that the poem was in all probability composed in Denmark, in honor of either Gorm the Old or Harald Blue-Tooth.
		His proof is based chiefly on the evidence provided by stanza <sr>49</sr>, and is summarized in the note to that stanza.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The poet, however, was certainly not a Dane, but probably a wandering Norse singer, who may have had a dozen homes, and who clearly had spent much time in some part of the western island world chiefly inhabited by Celts.
		The extent of Celtic influence on the Eddic poems in general is a matter of sharp dispute.
		Powell, for example, claims almost all the poems for the ``Western Isles,'' and attributes nearly all their good qualities to Celtic influence.
		Without here attempting to enter into the details of the argument, it may be said that the weight of authoritative opinion, while clearly recognizing the marks of Celtic influence in the poems, is against this view; contact between the roving Norsemen of Norway and Iceland and the Celts of Ireland and the ``Western Isles,'' and particularly the Orkneys, was so extensive as to make the presumption of an actual Celtic home for the poems seem quite unnecessary.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		In the case of the <cr>Rigsthula</cr> the poet unquestionably had not only picked up bits of the Celtic speech (the name Rig itself is almost certainly of Celtic origin, and there are various other Celtic words employed), but also had caught something of the Celtic literary spirit.
		This explains the cultural nature of the poem, quite foreign to Norse poetry in general.
		On the other hand, the style as a whole is vigorously Norse, and thus the explanation that the poem was composed by an itinerant Norse poet who had lived for some time in the Celtic islands, and who was on a visit to the court of a Danish king, fits the ascertainable facts exceedingly well.
		As Christianity was introduced into Denmark around 960, the <cr>Rigsthula</cr> is not likely to have been composed much after that date, and probably belongs to the first half of the tenth century.
		Gorm the Old died about the year 935, and was succeeded by Harald Blue-Tooth, who died about 985.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The fourteenth (or late thirteenth) century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, but there is nothing in the poem itself, and very little anywhere else, to warrant this, and it seems likely that the poet had Othin, and not Heimdall, in mind, his purpose being to trace the origin of the royal estate to the chief of the gods.
		The evidence bearing on this identification is briefly summed up in the note on the introductory prose passage, but the question involves complex and baffling problems in mythology, and from very early times the status of Heimdall was unquestionably confusing to the Norse mind.

			They tell in old stories that one of the gods, whose name was Heimdall, went on his way along a certain seashore, and came to a dwelling, where he called himself Rig.<br />
			According to these stories is the following poem:
		</translation>
		<comment>
			It would be interesting to know how much the annotator meant by the phrase old stories.
			Was he familiar with the tradition in forms other than that of the poem? If so, his introductory note was scanty, for, outside of identifying Rig as Heimdall, he provides no information not found in the poem.
			Probably he meant simply to refer to the poem itself as a relic of antiquity, and the identification of Rig as Heimdall may well have been an attempt at constructive criticism of his own.
			The note was presumably written somewhere about 1300, or even later, and there is no reason for crediting the annotator with any considerable knowledge of mythology.
			There is little to favor the identification of Rig with Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, beyond a few rather vague passages in the other poems.
			Thus in <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Voluspo">1</stanzaref>, the Volva asks hearing ``from Heimdall's sons both high and low''; in <chapterref>Grimnismol</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Grimnismol">13</stanzaref>, there is a very doubtful line which may mean that Heimdall ``o'er men holds sway, it is said,'' and in ``the Short <chapterref>Voluspo</chapterref>'' (<chapterref>Hyndluljoth</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Hyndluljoth">40</stanzaref>) he is called ``the kinsman of men.''
			On the other hand, everything in the <chapterref>Rigsthula</chapterref>, including the phrase ``the aged and wise'' in stanza <sr>1</sr>, and the references to runes in stanzas <sr>36</sr>, <sr>44</sr>, and <sr>46</sr>, fits Othin exceedingly well.
			It seems probable that the annotator was wrong, and that Rig is Othin, and not Heimdall.
			<expl>Rig</expl>: almost certainly based on the Old Irish word for ``king,'' ``ri'' or ``rig.''

			The manuscript of lines 1--3 is obviously defective, as there are too many words for two lines, and not enough for the full three.
			The meaning, however, is clearly very much as indicated in the translation.
			Gering's emendation, which I have followed, consists simply in shifting ``set before them'' from the first line to the second--where the manuscript has no verb,---and supplying the verb ``brought'' in line 1.
			The various editions contain all sorts of suggestions.

			The manuscript begins both line 1 and line 2 with a capital preceded by a period, which has led to all sorts of strange stanza-combinations and guesses at lost lines in the various editions.
			The confusion includes stanza <sr>33</sr>, wherein no line is marked in the manuscript as beginning a stanza.

			Lines 1, 2, and 5 all begin with capitals preceded by periods, a fact which, taken in conjunction with the obviously defective state of the following stanza, has led to all sorts of conjectural emendations.
			The exact significance of Rig's giving his own name to Jarl (cf. stanza <sr>46</sr>), and thus recognizing him, potentially at least, as a king, depends on the conditions under which the poem was composed (cf. <chapterref chatper="Rigsthula">Introductory Note</chapterref>).
			The whole stanza, particularly the reference to the teaching of magic (runes), fits Othin far better than Heimdall.

			The manuscript indicates no line as beginning a stanza.
			<expl>Kon the Young</expl>: a remarkable bit of fanciful etymology; the phrase is ``Konr ungr,'' which could readily be contracted into ``Konungr,'' the regular word meaning ``king.''
			The ``kon'' part is actually not far out, but the second syllable of ``konungr'' has nothing to do with ``ungr'' meaning ``young.''

			This fragment is not indicated as a separate stanza in the manuscript.

			<expl>Dan and Danp</expl>: These names are largely responsible for the theory that the <chapterref>Rigsthula</chapterref> was composed in Denmark.
			According to the Latin epitome of the <src>SkjÃ¶ldungasaga</src> by Arngrimur Jonsson, ``Rig (Rigus) was a man not the least among the great ones of his time.
			He married the daughter of a certain Danp, lord of Danpsted, whose name was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called Danes.''
			This may or may not be conclusive, and it is a great pity that the manuscript breaks off abruptly at this stanza.
