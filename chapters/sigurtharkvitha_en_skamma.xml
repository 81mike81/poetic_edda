		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		<chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha I</chapterref> is immediately followed in the <source>Codex Regius</source> by a long poem which in the manuscript bears the heading “Sigurtharkvitha,” but which is clearly referred to in the prose link between it and <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha I</chapterref> as the “short” Lay of Sigurth.
		The discrepancy between this reference and the obvious length of the poem has led to many conjectures, but the explanation seems to be that the “long” Sigurth lay, of which the <chapterref chapter="Brot af Sigurtharkvithu">Brot</chapterref> is presumably a part, was materially longer even than this poem.
		The efforts to reduce the “short” Sigurth lay to dimensions which would justify the appellation in comparison with other poems in the collection, either by separating it into two poems or by the rejection of many stanzas as interpolations, have been utterly inconclusive.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Although there are probably several interpolated passages, and indications of omissions are not lacking, the poem as we now have it seems to be a distinct and coherent unit.
		From the narrative point of view it leaves a good deal to be desired, for the reason that the poet's object was by no means to tell a story, with which his hearers were quite familiar, but to use the narrative simply as the background for vivid and powerful characterization.
		The lyric element, as Mogk points out, overshadows the epic throughout, and the fact that there are frequent confusions of narrative tradition does not trouble the poet at all.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The material on which the poem was based seems to have existed in both prose and verse form; the poet was almost certainly familiar with some of the other poems in the Eddic collection, with poems which have since been lost, and with the narrative prose traditions which never fully assumed verse form.
		The fact that he seems to have known and used the <chapterref>Oddrunargratr</chapterref>, which can hardly have been composed before 1050, and that in any case he introduces the figure of Oddrun, a relatively late addition to the story, dates the poem as late as the end of the eleventh century, or even the first half of the twelfth.
		There has been much discussion as to where it was composed, the debate centering chiefly on the reference to glaciers (stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">8</stanzaref>).
		There is something to be said in favor of Greenland as the original home of the poem (cf. introductory note to <chapterref>Atlakvitha</chapterref>), but the arguments for Iceland are even stronger; Norway in this case is practically out of the question.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The narrative features of the poem are based on the German rather than the Norse elements of the story (cf. introductory note to <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>), but the poet has taken whatever material he wanted without much discrimination as to its source.
		By the year 1100 the story of Sigurth, with its allied legends, existed through out the North in many and varied forms, and the poem shows traces of variants of the main story which do not appear elsewhere.

			This stanza may refer, as Gering thinks, merely to the fact that Brynhild lived happy and unsuspecting as Gunnar's wife until the fatal quarrel with Guthrun (cf. <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">45</stanzaref> and note) revealed to her the deceit whereby she had been won, or it may refer to the version of the story which appears in stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">32</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">39</stanzaref>, wherein Brynhild lived happily with Atli, her brother, until he was attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, and was compelled to give his sister to Gunnar, winning her consent thereto by representing Gunnar as Sigurth, her chosen hero (cf. <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha I</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Guthrunarkvitha I">24</stanzaref> and note).
			The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and many editors combine it with stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">6</stanzaref>.

			Brynhild has now discovered the deceit that has been practised on her.
			That she had loved Sigurth from the outset (cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">40</stanzaref>) fits well with the version of the story wherein Sigurth meets her before he comes to Gunnar's home (the version not used in this poem), or the one outlined in the note on stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">5</stanzaref>, but does not accord with the story of Sigurth's first meeting Brynhild in Gunnar's form—an added reason for believing that the poet in stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">5</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">6</stanzaref> had in mind the story represented by stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">32</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">39</stanzaref>.

			No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and many editors combine stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">21</stanzaref> with stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">22</stanzaref>, but it seems likely that not only two lines, but one or more stanzas in addition, have been lost; cf. <chapterref chapter="Brot af Sigurtharkvithu">Brot</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Brot af Sigurtharkvithu">4</stanzaref>, and also the detailed account of the slaying of Sigurth in the <source>Volsungasaga</source>, wherein, as here, Sigurth is killed in his bed (cf. stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">24</stanzaref>) and not in the forest.

			This stanza, which all editors have accepted as an integral part of the poem, apparently refers to the same story represented by stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">37</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">39</stanzaref>, which most editors have (I believe mistakenly) marked as interpolated.
			As is pointed out in the notes on stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">3</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">5</stanzaref>, <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">6</stanzaref> and <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">10</stanzaref>, the poet throughout seems to have accepted the version of the story wherein Gunnar and Sigurth besiege Atli, and are bought off by the gift of Atli's sister, Brynhild, to Gunnar as wife, her consent being won by Atli's representation that Gunnar is Sigurth (cf. also <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha I</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Guthrunarkvitha I">24</stanzaref> and note).

			Some editions place this stanza after stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">39</stanzaref>, on the theory that stanzas <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">37</stanzaref>–<stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">39</stanzaref> are interpolated.
			Line 4, as virtually a repetition of line 3, has generally been marked as spurious.
			In this version of the winning of Brynhild it appears that Atli pointed out Sigurth as Gunnar, and Brynhild promptly fell in love with the hero whom, as he rode on Grani and was decked with some of the spoils taken from Fafnir, she recognized as the dragon's slayer.
			Thus no change of form between Sigurth and Gunnar was necessary.
			The oath to marry Gunnar had to be carried out even after Brynhild had discovered the deception.

			Perhaps the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and after line 4 an added line has been suggested:
			<textstanza class="translation">
				She was ever known<sep />for evil thoughts.
			</textstanza>
			<textstanza class="original">
				(aumlig vǣttr<sep />illu heilli.)
			</textstanza>
			On the other hand, line 1, identical with line 1 of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">17</stanzaref>, may well be a mere expansion of “Hogni spake,” and line 6 may have been introduced, with a slight variation, from line 5 of stanza <stanzaref chapter="Sigurtharkvitha en skamma">38</stanzaref>.
			<expl>Born again</expl>: this looks like a trace of Christian influence (the poem was composed well after the coming of Christianity to Iceland) in the assumption that if Brynhild killed herself she could not be “born again” (cf. <proseref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II" prose="conclusion">concluding prose</proseref> to <chapterref>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</chapterref>).
