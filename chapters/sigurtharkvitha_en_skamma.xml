			The Short Lay of Sigurth

		Introductory Note
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		<cr>Guthrunarkvitha I</cr> is immediately followed in the <src>Codex Regius</src> by a long poem which in the manuscript bears the heading ``Sigurtharkvitha,'' but which is clearly referred to in the prose link between it and <cr>Guthrunarkvitha I</cr> as the ``short'' Lay of Sigurth.
		The discrepancy between this reference and the obvious length of the poem has led to many conjectures, but the explanation seems to be that the ``long'' Sigurth lay, of which the <chapterref chapter="Brot af Sigurtharkvithu">Brot</chapterref> is presumably a part, was materially longer even than this poem.
		The efforts to reduce the ``short'' Sigurth lay to dimensions which would justify the appellation in comparison with other poems in the collection, either by separating it into two poems or by the rejection of many stanzas as interpolations, have been utterly inconclusive.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		Although there are probably several interpolated passages, and indications of omissions are not lacking, the poem as we now have it seems to be a distinct and coherent unit.
		From the narrative point of view it leaves a good deal to be desired, for the reason that the poet's object was by no means to tell a story, with which his hearers were quite familiar, but to use the narrative simply as the background for vivid and powerful characterization.
		The lyric element, as Mogk points out, overshadows the epic throughout, and the fact that there are frequent confusions of narrative tradition does not trouble the poet at all.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The material on which the poem was based seems to have existed in both prose and verse form; the poet was almost certainly familiar with some of the other poems in the Eddic collection, with poems which have since been lost, and with the narrative prose traditions which never fully assumed verse form.
		The fact that he seems to have known and used the <cr>Oddrunargratr</cr>, which can hardly have been composed before 1050, and that in any case he introduces the figure of Oddrun, a relatively late addition to the story, dates the poem as late as the end of the eleventh century, or even the first half of the twelfth.
		There has been much discussion as to where it was composed, the debate centering chiefly on the reference to glaciers (stanza <sr>8</sr>).
		There is something to be said in favor of Greenland as the original home of the poem (cf. introductory note to <cr>Atlakvitha</cr>), but the arguments for Iceland are even stronger; Norway in this case is practically out of the question.
	</block>
	<block class="text">
		The narrative features of the poem are based on the German rather than the Norse elements of the story (cf. introductory note to <cr>Gripisspo</cr>), but the poet has taken whatever material he wanted without much discrimination as to its source.
		By the year 1100 the story of Sigurth, with its allied legends, existed through out the North in many and varied forms, and the poem shows traces of variants of the main story which do not appear elsewhere.

			This stanza may refer, as Gering thinks, merely to the fact that Brynhild lived happy and unsuspecting as Gunnar's wife until the fatal quarrel with Guthrun (cf. <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Gripisspo">45</stanzaref> and note) revealed to her the deceit whereby she had been won, or it may refer to the version of the story which appears in stanzas <sr>32</sr>--<sr>39</sr>, wherein Brynhild lived happily with Atli, her brother, until he was attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, and was compelled to give his sister to Gunnar, winning her consent thereto by representing Gunnar as Sigurth, her chosen hero (cf. <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha I</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Guthrunarkvitha I">24</stanzaref> and note).
			The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and many editors combine it with stanza <sr>6</sr>.

		<comment>
			Brynhild has now discovered the deceit that has been practised on her.
			That she had loved Sigurth from the outset (cf. stanza <sr>40</sr>) fits well with the version of the story wherein Sigurth meets her before he comes to Gunnar's home (the version not used in this poem), or the one outlined in the note on stanza <sr>5</sr>, but does not accord with the story of Sigurth's first meeting Brynhild in Gunnar's form---an added reason for believing that the poet in stanzas <sr>5</sr>--<sr>6</sr> had in mind the story represented by stanzas <sr>32</sr>--<sr>39</sr>.
			<expl>The hero</expl>: the manuscript originally had the phrase thus, then corrected it to ``though I die,'' and finally crossed out the correction.

			This stanza, which all editors have accepted as an integral part of the poem, apparently refers to the same story represented by stanzas <sr>37</sr>--<sr>39</sr>, which most editors have (I believe mistakenly) marked as interpolated.
			As is pointed out in the notes on stanzas <sr>3</sr>, <sr>5</sr>, <sr>6</sr> and <sr>10</sr>, the poet throughout seems to have accepted the version of the story wherein Gunnar and Sigurth besiege Atli, and are bought off by the gift of Atli's sister, Brynhild, to Gunnar as wife, her consent being won by Atli's representation that Gunnar is Sigurth (cf. also <chapterref>Guthrunarkvitha I</chapterref>, <stanzaref chapter="Guthrunarkvitha I">24</stanzaref> and note).

			Line 4, as virtually a repetition of line 3, has generally been marked as spurious.
			In this version of the winning of Brynhild it appears that Atli pointed out Sigurth as Gunnar, and Brynhild promptly fell in love with the hero whom, as he rode on Grani and was decked with some of the spoils taken from Fafnir, she recognized as the dragon's slayer.
			Thus no change of form between Sigurth and Gunnar was necessary.
			The oath to marry Gunnar had to be carried out even after Brynhild had discovered the deception.

			<expl>Born again</expl>: this looks like a trace of Christian influence (the poem was composed well after the coming of Christianity to Iceland) in the assumption that if Brynhild killed herself she could not be ``born again'' (cf. <proseref chapter="Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II" prose="conclusion">concluding prose</proseref> to <chapterref>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</chapterref>).

			This stanza probably ought to follow stanza <sr>52</sr>, as it refers solely to) the winning of Brynhild by Gunnar and Sigurth.
			Müllenhoff regards stanzas <sr>53</sr>--<sr>55</sr> as interpolated.
			The manuscript indicates no gap after line 3.

			Stanzas <sr>57</sr>--<sr>58</sr> seem to be the remains of two stanzas, but the <src>Volsungasaga</src> paraphrase follows closely the form here given.
			Line 3 may well be spurious; line 5 has likewise been questioned.
			<expl>Oddrun</expl>: this sister of Atli and Brynhild, known mainly through the <chapterref>Oddrunargratr</chapterref>, is a purely northern addition to the cycle, and apparently one of a relatively late date.
			She figures solely by reason of her love affair with Gunnar.

			Line 3 may well be spurious, as it is largely repetition.
			The manuscript has ``sofa'' (``sleep'') in place of ``sona'' (``sons''), but the <src>Volsungasaga</src> paraphrase says clearly ``sons.''
			The slaying of Atli by Guthrun in revenge for his killing of her brothers is told in the two Atli lays.
			The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 4--5, or else combine them with stanza <sr>60</sr>.

			<expl>Jonak</expl>: this king, known only through the <chapterref>Hamthesmol</chapterref> and the stories which, like this one, are based thereon, is another purely northern addition to the legend.
			The name is apparently of Slavic origin.
			He appears solely as Guthrun's third husband and the father of Hamther, Sorli, and Erp (cf. <proseref chapter="Guthrunarhvot" prose="p1">introductory prose</proseref> to <chapterref>Guthrunarhvot</chapterref>).

		<comment>
			<expl>Bikki</expl>: Svanhild is married to the aged Jormunrek (Ermanarich), but Eikki, one of his followers, suggests that she is unduly intimate with Jormunrek's son, Randver.
			Thereupon Jormunrek has Randver hanged, and Svanhild torn to pieces by wild horses.
			Ermanarich's cruelty and his barbarous slaying of his wife and son were familiar traditions long before they be came in any way connected with the Sigurth cycle (cf. introductory note to <chapterref>Gripisspo</chapterref>).

		<comment>
			In place of lines 3--4 the manuscript has one line
			<textstanza class="translation">
				Two at his head,<sep />and a pair of hawks;
			</textstanza>
			the addition is made from the Volsungasaga paraphrase.
			The burning or burying of slaves or beasts to accompany their masters in death was a general custom in the North.
			The number of slaves indicated in this stanza does not tally with the one given in stanza <sr>69</sr>, wherefore Vigfusson rejects most of this stanza.
