==================
Poetic Edda diglot
==================

This project aims at producing the book with parallel Old Norse and English texts of Poetic Edda.
I am using the `translation by Henry Adams Bellows <http://www.archive.org/details/poeticedda00belluoft>`_,
because it is considered to be quite accurate and has detailed comments.
As for the original text, at the moment of writing this I am using
`"Die Lieder der Ã¤lteren Edda" <http://www.archive.org/details/dieliederderedda0301geriuoft>`_
by Karl Hildebrand and Hugo Gering (this book was the main source for Bellows).

I will appreciate any proofreading (chapter, part of the chapter, only English or only Old Norse) ---
there are still lots of typos out there.

This book is built by XeLaTeX, with most of the .tex files produced
from JSON data in ``chapters`` directory by ``build.py`` script.
This will help if I ever decide to start using ``ledmac`` and ``ledpar`` packages again.
