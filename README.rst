==================
Poetic Edda diglot
==================

This project aims at producing the book with parallel Old Norse and English texts of Poetic Edda.
I am using the `translation by Henry Adams Bellows <http://www.archive.org/details/poeticedda00belluoft>`_,
because it is considered to be quite accurate and has detailed comments.
As for the original text, at the moment of writing this I am using
`"Die Lieder der Ã¤lteren Edda" <http://www.archive.org/details/dieliederderlt00hilduoft>`_
by Karl Hildebrand and Hugo Gering (this book was the main source for Bellows).

I will appreciate any proofreading (chapter, part of the chapter, only English or only Old Norse) ---
there are still lots of typos out there.

This book is built by XeLaTeX, with most of the .tex files produced
from XML data in ``chapters`` directory by ``build.py`` script.
This will help if I ever decide to start using ``ledmac`` and ``ledpar`` packages again.

Modifications of Gering source
------------------------------

I tried to copy Old Norse stanzas from Gering's book as accurate as possible,
but I had to make a few modifications in order to make them conform to
Bellows's book.

First, Gering and Bellows use slightly different glyphs for Old Norse: the main difference is
that Gering uses acute mark for long vowels, when Bellows uses macron.
The latter approach seems logical, because it helps to distinguish between long vowel marks and accent marks.
In addition, Bellows uses "o with diaeresis" instead of "o with stroke"
and "o with double acute" instead of "o with stroke and acute".
But since Gering uses diaeresis with i and e to mark the separate pronounciation in a diphthong,
this can become confusing; so I kept "o with stroke", but used macron instead of acute sign
to mark the longetivity.
It may be incorrect from the linguistic point of view, but it helps to read the Old Norse text.
I will be glad to hear any professional opinion about this.

Since the reader can see the Old Norse original near the translation, I omitted the
proper names index from Bellows's book (although I can include it later,
because it shows the accented syllables in names), leaving only the pronounciation guide
(where I made modifications according to the set of glyphs I use).
I have not cut any references to the index though, because that would require rearranging the text,
and I do not want to do that yet.

Tasks for distant future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add all remaining chapters;
* Add support for different paper sizes (in particular, try to typeset a proper book);
* Try to use footnotes instead of normal text for comments;
* Probably make build script run xelatex too?
* Check all overfull hboxes (I'm leaving this check for the future, becasue I do not
  know how long the stanza names in other chapters will be).
* Proofread everything
* Find a way to disable page breaks between comments and stanzas (seems to be the issue of longtable)
* Find a way to not typeset \eddasepline if it is at the end of the page (can TeX even do that?)
* Find a way to keep line separation in stanzas even when the line is too long
  (or just tune the column widths to avoid oversized hboxes in stanzas)
* Do not break the line after ndash separating two numbers
* Refactor scripts
* Add all missing text from paperback (i.e., Acknowledgement and
  list of proper names)
* Make the vertical space inside the stanza before <stanzaprelude>
  a bit bigger than between two normal lines.
  See any <stanzaprelude> usage in Bellows book.
* Check spaces between single and double quotes and between double quotes and apostrophes
  (thin space needed?)
* Put original and translated textstanzas in comments side-by-side
  (and delete parentheses from original stanzas)
* Check that phrases like 'prose after stanza 5' are single references to prose,
  not one ref to prose and one to stanza
* Draw just <lacuna> instead of <lacuna><sep><lacuna>, unless <sep>
  is just a long space (or maybe draw some "long" lacuna)
* HHII: probably make separate style for in-prose stanza (p17, class="prosestanza"),
  so that the whole prose would be enclosed in a single block
* Add hyphenation helpers for all chapter names (TODO: can't remember why
  I mentioned this; have to find place where TeX's hyphenation algorithm fails)
  Need to add non-breakable spaces in chapter names too (like Smth~II)
* Try to use two cells separated by \nopagebreaks for stanza lines with <sep />
  (this may help to avoid uneven cell spacing)
* Probably make second-level square brackets bold
  (see how it's done in Sigrdrifumol in Gering source)
* Check the style of "Some chapter II" references throughout the Bellows' book:
  sometimes "II" are in italics (introduction to Guthrunarkvitha I),
  sometimes not.
* Sometimes when <textstanza-original> goes after <textstanza-translation> there is no need in '.' in the first one: it was put there in Bellows' book, just because it finished the sentence.
  Need to check all such places in the book and remove
  unnecessary '.'.
