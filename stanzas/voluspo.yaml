- comment: !!python/unicode 'A few editors, following Bugge, in an effort to clarify
    the poem, place stanzas 22, 28 and 30 before stanzas 1\ndash20, but the arrangement
    in both manuscripts, followed here, seems logical. In stanza 1 the Volva, or wise-woman,
    called upon by Othin, answers him and demands a hearing. Evidently she belongs
    to the race of the giants (cf. stanza 2), and thus speaks to Othin unwillingly,
    being compelled to do so by his magic power. \emph{Holy:} omitted in \emph{Regius;}
    the phrase ``holy races'''' probably means little more than mankind in general.
    \emph{Heimdall:} the watchman of the gods; cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind
    should be referred to as Heimdall''s sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused
    much perplexity. Heimdall seems to have had various at tributes, and in the Rigsthula,
    wherein a certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men,
    a fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what authority
    we do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like Othin (cf. Rigsthula,
    introductory prose and note). \emph{Valfather} (``Father of the Slain''''): Othin,
    chief of the gods, so called because the slain warriors were brought to him at
    Valhall (``Hall of the Slain'''') by the Valkyries (``Choosers of the Slain'''').'

    The story referred to in stanzas 25\ndash26 (both quoted by Snorri) is that of
    the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction by the Wanes. The gods employed
    a giant as builder, who demanded as his reward the sun and moon, and the goddess
    Freyja for his wife. The gods, terrified by the rapid progress of the work, forced
    Loki, who had advised the bargain, to delay the giant by a trick, so that the
    {[}fp. 12{]} work was not finished in the stipulated time (cf. \emph{Grimnismol,}
    44, note). The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew him.

    under Yggdrasil. \emph{Valfather''s pledge:} Othin''s eye (the sun?), which he
    gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in exchange for the latter''s wisdom.
    It appears here and in stanza 29 as a drinking-vessel, from which Mimir drinks
    the magic mead, and from which he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil. Othin''s sacrifice
    of his eye in order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of the series of
    disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several differing

    was presumably brought to Scandinavia in very early times from the South-Germanic
    races, and later it was interwoven with the likewise South-Germanic tradition
    of the swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the originally quite human

- comment: !!python/unicode 'This stanza is quoted by Snorri. \emph{Gimle:} Snorri
    makes this the name of the hall itself, while here it appears to refer to a mountain
    on which the hall stands. It is the home of the happy, as opposed to another hall,
    not here mentioned, for the dead. Snorri''s description of this second hall is
    based on \emph{Voluspo,} 38, which he quotes, and perhaps that stanza properly
    belongs after 64.'

- comment: !!python/unicode 'This stanza is not found in \emph{Regius,} and is probably
    spurious. No lacuna is indicated in the \emph{Hauksbok} version, but late paper
    manuscripts add two lines, running:


    ``Rule he orders,{\sep}and rights he fixes,

    Laws he ordains{\sep}that ever shall live.''''


    The name of this new ruler is nowhere given, and of course the suggestion of Christianity
    is unavoidable. It is not certain, how ever, that even this stanza refers to Christianity,
    and if it does, it may have been interpolated long after the rest of the poem
    was composed.'

- comment: !!python/unicode 'This stanza, which fits so badly with the preceding ones,
    {[}fp. 27{]} may well have been interpolated. It has been suggested that the dragon,
    making a last attempt to rise, is destroyed, this event marking the end of evil
    in the world. But in both manuscripts the final half-line does not refer to the
    dragon, but, as the gender shows, to the Volva herself, who sinks into the earth;
    a sort of conclusion to the entire prophecy. Presumably the stanza (barring the
    last half-line, which was probably intended as the conclusion of the poem) belongs
    somewhere in the description of the great struggle. \emph{Nithhogg:} the dragon
    at the roots of Yggdrasil; cf. stanza 39 and note. \emph{Nithafjoll} (``the Dark
    Crags''''); nowhere else mentioned. \emph{Must I:} the manuscripts have ``must
    she.'''''
